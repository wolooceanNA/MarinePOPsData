Caution: It is recommended to conduct detailed inspection before using the data, because the data identification and drawing are completed by one person, and there is a lack of correction process.

Historical data of seawater and marine atmospheric persistent organic pollutants identified through OCR technology
This project using OCR technology extracted data on multiple persistent organic pollutants from tables, texts and pictures in historical documents. Currently, it only includes homologues of polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides (Hexachlorocyclohexane, DDT, Dieldrin etc. )
The information provided includes date, latitude and longitude, sea area division based on (International Maritime Organization) IMO, concentration and water vapor exchange data.
Some data are estimated through context, please refer to the annotation in NOTE.
Here are some relevant descriptive info by figureï¼š
Time series of persistent organic pollutants in the marine atmosphere:

Take this picture as an example, which shows the HCB concentration (based on the size of the circle) and the time of detection (based on the color)

Similarly, this graph shows HCB flux information. However, there is a lack of flux size data because most literature has not reported it.
