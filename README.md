# MarinePOPsData
Historical data of seawater and marine atmospheric persistent organic pollutants identified through OCR technology
This project using OCR technology extracted data on multiple persistent organic pollutants from tables, texts and pictures in historical documents. Currently, it only includes homologues of polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides (Hexachlorocyclohexane, DDT, Dieldrin etc. )
The information provided includes date, latitude and longitude, sea area division based on (International Maritime Organization) IMO, concentration and water vapor exchange data.
Some data are estimated through context, please refer to the annotation in NOTE.
Here are some relevant descriptive info by figureï¼š
