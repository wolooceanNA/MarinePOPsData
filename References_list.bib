  abstract = {Major urban and industrial centers increase loadings of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) to proximate sea waters through riverine transport, atmospheric deposition via dry particle deposition, wet deposition, and air-sea gas exchange. In addition to acting as sinks for SVOCs, oceans can act as sources of SVOCs to coastal atmospheres and play important roles in the global biogeochemistry of SVOCs. Particle-sorbed SVOCs can settle to the ocean surface by dry particle deposition, a uni-directional advective transport process from the atmosphere to the water, the removal rate by which is a function of the physical and chemical properties of the aerosols and bound pollutants, meteorological conditions and surface characteristics. In addition, SVOCs are removed from the atmosphere and transported to the waters by precipitation scavenging of atmospheric vapors and particles, which are incorporated into the rain within or below the clouds. After SVOCs are deposited into the bulk seawater, water-column partitioning can affect the distribution of pollutants between the dissolved aqueous and the solid phases and eventually impact the fate of these compounds in oceans. Other than the abovementioned processes, air-sea exchange can make SVOCs diffuse across the air-sea interface; however, the sea surface microlayer (SML), a unique compartment at the air-sea boundary defined operationally as the upper millimeter (1 {$\sim$} 1000 {$\mu$}m) of the sea surface, has large storage capacity to delay the transport of SVOCs across the interface.},

Consideration is given as to the extent to which it has undergone repeated air-surface exchange or dhoppingT to become globally dispersed, the balance between primary and secondary sources in maintaining ambient levels, and its ultimate sinks in the environment. Global production exceeded 100,000 tonnes and primary emissions to atmosphere probably peaked in the 1970s. There has been a consistent downward trend in the environment over the past 20 years. Temporal trends of HCB in the environment vary, dependent on time period measured, media studied and study location, but the average half-life from all the studies is {\textasciitilde}9 years. Estimates are made of the contemporary burden in the environment; these range between 10,000 and 26,000 tonnes and are dominated by the loadings in treated and background soils, sediments and oceans. Estimates of the trends of HCB emissions from treated soils are derived. At its peak, the amount of HCB emitted from soil to air may have been in the hundreds to thousands of tonnes per year, which would have made it a significant source of HCB to the environment. Whilst the amount of HCB being emitted from contemporary soil is much lower, only a small amount of re-emission of HCB from soil to air is required to maintain contemporary air concentrations under the current primary emission scenario.

  abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) continue to receive widespread attention as harmful contaminants in the global environment. Increasingly, there have been concerns regarding adverse effects on marine wildlife due to the potential of POPs to induce adverse health effects, including the disruption of endocrine systems. Marine water samples within one kilometer of the coastline of Singapore were analysed to determine prevalent concentrations of a range of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Samples were collected from 0.5 m and mid-depth (approximately 14 m depth) at twenty-two locations. POPs analysed are classed as USEPA priority pollutants, and included: sixteen polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); eight polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); and twelve organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). Total PAH concentrations varied from 88.44 to 1419.57 ng l-1 at the surface, and 129.78 to 940.41 ng l-1 at mid-depth. Total OCP concentrations varied between 4.90 ng l-1 to 22.04 ng l-1 at surface, and 4.09 to 18.05 ng l-1 at mid-depth. Total PCB concentrations varied from 0.22 ng l-1 to 20.41 ng l-1 at surface and 0.4 to 10.79 ng l-1 at mid-depth. In general, the distribution profile shows that the surface concentrations of POPs are higher than at mid depth. Concentrations of PAHs were considered higher than reported levels for several other countries, whereas levels of OCPs and PCBs are generally lower than reported levels for other Asian countries.},

An automated Soxhlet (Soxtec) extraction method was used for extraction with hexane{\textendash}acetone as a solvent, and a pre-washed multilayer silica gel column was used for the clean-up step. Samples were analyzed using capillary gas chromatography (GC) with an electron capture detector (ECD) and GC{\textendash}mass spectrometry (GC{\textendash}MS) for confirmation. The method's limits of detection (LOD) were determined to be from 0.40 to 1.53 ng/L and from 0.39 to 0.91 ng/g dry weight for seawater and sediment, respectively. Concentrations of PCBs in seawater and sediment samples from all sites were below the LOD. This study provides evidence that very low concentrations of PCBs ({$<$}2 ng/g) were found in the water and sediments of the Jordanian coast of the Gulf of Aqaba. PCB concentrations measured in this study can be considered as a baseline for future monitoring and control of PCBs as requested by the Stockholm Convention.},

The Mediterranean and Black seas are unique marine environments subject to important anthropogenic pressures due to direct and indirect loads of atmospheric inputs of organochlorine compounds (OCls) from primary and secondary sources. Here we report the results obtained during two east{\textendash}west sampling cruises in June 2006 and May 2007 from Barcelona to Istanbul and Alexandria, respectively, where gas-phase and aerosol-phase samples were collected. Both matrices were analyzed for 41 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), including dioxin-like congeners, and hexachlorobenzene (HCB). The values reported in this study for gas-phase HCB and {$\sum$}41PCB limit of detection (LOD) to 418.3 pg m-3 and from 81.99 to 931.6 pg m-3 respectively) are in the same range of those reported in former studies, possibly suggesting a limited decline in their atmospheric concentrations during the last decade for the Mediterranean region due to land-based OCl sources. There is a clear influence of the direction of the air mass on the atmospheric concentrations of PCBs, with higher concentrations when the air mass was from southern Europe, and the lowest concentrations for air masses coming from the SW Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean. PCBs and HCB are close to air{\textendash}water equilibrium for most sampling periods, thus resulting in low atmospheric deposition fluxes at open sea. This is consistent with the oligotrophic character of the Mediterranean Sea with a small influence of the biological pump capturing atmospheric PCBs. Therefore, degradation of gas-phase PCBs by OH radicals is estimated to be the main loss process of atmospheric PCBs during their transport over the Mediterranean Sea. Conversely, atmospheric residence times of HCB are predicted to be very long due to a lack of atmospheric degradation and low depositional fluxes due to concentrations at air{\textendash}water equilibrium.},

Here, we report the results obtained during two east{\`A}west sampling cruises in June 2006 and May 2007 from Barcelona to Istanbul and Alexandria, respectively, where water and plankton samples were collected simultaneously. Both matrixes were analyzed for hexaclorochyclohexanes (HCHs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and 41 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners. The comparison of the measured HCB and HCHs concentrations with previously reported dissolved phase concentrations suggests a temporal decline in their concentrations since the 1990s. On the contrary, PCB seawater concentrations did not exhibit such a decline, but show a significant spatial variability in dissolved concentrations with lower levels in the open Western and South Eastern Mediterranean, and higher concentrations in the Black, Marmara, and Aegean Seas and Sicilian Strait. PCB and OCPs (organochlorine pesticides) concentrations in plankton were higher at lower plankton biomass, but the intensity of this trend depended on the compound hydrophobicity (KOW). For the more persistent PCBs and HCB, the observed dependence of POP concentrations in plankton versus biomass can be explained by interactions between air{\`A}water exchange, particle settling, and/or bioaccumulation processes, whereas degradation processes occurring in the photic zone drive the trends shown by the more labile HCHs. The results presented here provide clear evidence of the important physical and biogeochemical controls on POP occurrence in the marine environment.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric transport and exchange of pesticides with soil, vegetation, water and atmospheric particles are discussed, with an emphasis on applying physicochemical properties of the compound to describe environmental partitioning. The octanol-air partition coefficient is promoted as a unifying property for describing volatilization of pesticides from soil and sorption to aerosols. Present-day sources of organochlorine (OC) pesticides to the atmosphere are continued usage in certain countries and volatilization from contaminated soils where they were used in the past. Models are available to predict volatilization from soil; however, their implementation is hampered by lack of soil residue data on a regional scale. The need to differentiate "new" and "old" sources is increasing, as countries negotiate international controls on persistent organic pollutants (POPs). A new technique, based on the analysis of individual pesticide enantiomers, is proposed to follow emission of chiral OC pesticides from soil and water. Air monitoring programs in the Arctic show the ubiquitous presence of OC pesticides, PCBs and other POPs, and recently a few "modern" pesticides have been identified in fog and surface seawater. Atmospheric loadings of POPs to oceans and large lakes take place mainly by air-water gas exchange. In the case of OC pesticides and PCBs, aquatic systems are often near air-water equilibrium or even oversaturated. Measurement of water/air fugacity ratios suggests revolatilization of PCBs and several OC pesticides in the Great Lakes and, for ahexachlorocyclohexane (a-HCH), in the Arctic Ocean. Outgassing of a-HCH in large lakes and arctic waters has been confirmed by enantiomeric tracer studies. The potential for pesticides to be atmospherically transported depends on their ability to be mobilized into air and the removal processes that take place enroute: wet and dry deposition of gases and particles and chemical reactions in the atmosphere. Measurement of reaction rate constants for pesticides in the gas and particle phase at a range of environmental temperatures is a critical research need. The transport distance of a chemical is related to its overall environmental persistence, determined by the partitioning among different compartments (water, sediment, soil, air), degradation rates in each compartment and mode of emission (into water, soil, air). Several pesticides found in the arctic environment have predicted lifetimes in the gas phase of only a few days in temperate climates, pointing out the need for monitoring and evaluation of persistence in cold regions.},

Mean concentrations of OCs (pg/m3) were: hexachlorocyclohexanes ({\textasciitilde}-HCH + y-HCH) - 250, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs, sum of 38 congeners) = 52, polychlorocamphenes (PCCs) = 35, , chlordanes + nonachlors = 15, heptachlor epoxide = 5.2, p,p'-DDT + p,p'-DDE = 4.5. Endosulfan (sum of two isomers) and dieldrin concentrations were 24-159 and 9-12 pg/m3 in summer samples. The sum of 3-5 ring PAHs ranged from 553 - 842 pg/m3, and was dominated by 3-ring (92\%) followed by 4-ring (6\%) and 5-ring (2\%) compounds. HCHs in rain (3.6-7.3 ng/L) and seawater (1.2-2.1 ng/L) were similar to other values reported for the North Atlantic and eastern Canada.

Performance reference compounds (PRCs) were added to the SPMDs prior to exposure for measuring the in situ exchange kinetics. For PCBs, a fair degree of equilibrium between atmosphere and water was found. HCB concentrations in the atmosphere were about eight times higher than the equilibrium concentration. PCB concentrations in seawater and atmosphere fell by a factor of 2{$\pm$} 10, respectively, during the sampling period. HCB concentrations in water increased by a factor of 2. Atmospheric concentrations of HCB showed a decrease by a factor of about 10. Results for the sea-surface microlayer (SSM) deployment showed that the chemical activities at the air{$\pm$}water interface did not dier from those in deeper water layers.

PCB concentrations measured in zooplankton and fish were within the laboratory's accredited quality assured criteria, and were comparable to other Arctic regions. Although on a different scale, the predicted and measured PCB concentrations were highly correlated. As sensitivity analyses indicated water concentrations as the most sensitive parameter for the model output, dissolved water concentrations were predicted using measured zooplankton and air PCB concentrations, and empirical and mechanistic models. The food web model and the empirical relationship between bioaccumPulation factor and octanol{\textendash}water partitioning coefficient predicted mean dissolved water concentrations of 28 and 29 pg/L PCB6 (PCB-28, -52, -105, -118, -138P, -153), respectively. Mean dissolved water concentration predicted from measured air concentrations in 1996 was 7.6 pg/L PCB5 (PCB-28 was not analysed). Mean dPissolved water concentration measured in Barents Sea water sampled simultaneously as the biota in 1999 was 0.3 pg/L PCB6. The dissolved water concentrations predicted from zooplankton PCB concentrations were comparable to water concentrations measured in 1996, whereas the dissolved water concentrations measured in 1999 were comparable to measurements from 2001. If the present high empirically derived bioaccumulation factors (log BAF 7.3{\textendash}9.0) were realistic, this suggests that bioaccumulation in Arctic zooplankton is more efficient that previously assumed. The present study illustrates and discusses some of the difficulties encountered when different approaches to study environmental distribution of contaminants are compared.},

Water samples were taken in six stations in the Porto-Romano area, in May 2016. Organochlorinated compounds were measured by gas chromatography electron capture detection. These compounds were extracted using liquid-liquid technique using n-hexane as extracting solvent. After extraction the organic phase was dried with 5 g Na2SO4 anhidrous, to remove water. A Florisil column was used for the sample clean-up. After the concentration to 1 ml, the samples were injected in GC/ECD HP 6890 Series II. Results showed that even if organochlorine pesticide production stopped by the 90's in Albania, data shows persistent levels of organochlorinated pesticides were still found in all water samples.These data highlight the importance of a continuous environmental monitoring of polluted area subjected to protect human's and wildlife's health.},

A comparison with a dated sediment core reveals that the model is not capable of reproducing some key features of the observed, historical, long-term trend in sediments, although better agreement is observed for six of seven PCB congeners over the last two decades. The model also underestimates the concentrations of PCBs in surface sediments in areas adjacent to the city of Oslo (Norway). In general, deviations between modeled and observed concentrations indicate that the historical emissions and discharges of PCBs are not sufficiently characterized and described. Net fluxes predicted by the model suggest that several congeners may have experienced a reversal of air{\textendash}water and seawater{\textendash}sediment exchange during the last decade or even earlier. The present study further suggests that the benefit of the proposed removal of the most contaminated sediments of the Inner Oslofjord needs to be assessed, with consideration of the relative contribution of current atmospheric inputs as well as the leaching of PCBs from less contaminated sediments.},

  abstract = {Air/sea gas exchange is an important process for the environmental fate of many semivolatile organic compounds (SOCs). The ability to quantify this flux can be very useful, e.g. for understanding the role of seas as a sink or a source for SOCs. In this work the air/sea gas exchange of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was investigated in the Baltic Sea, a particularly contaminated marine ecosystem. Air and water samples were collected during three cruises in the southern Baltic Sea and analysed for eight PCB congeners. Water/air fugacity ratios were calculated using literature values for the air/water partition coefficients. A sensitivity analysis indicated that it was not possible to identify the direction of net air/sea exchange of gaseous PCBs with 95\% certainty due to the uncertainty in the air/water partition coefficients. Even when this uncertainty was reduced by using a recent set of internally consistent physical{\textendash}chemical properties of PCBs, the direction of the net flux was only ascertainable for PCB 28/31. The uncertainty in the fugacity ratio rendered a quantification of the air/sea exchange flux impossible. Nevertheless, the observation that the PCBs in the air/sea system were relatively close to a partitioning equilibrium was useful in identifying discrepancies and weaknesses in existing estimates of the PCB mass balance for the Baltic Sea. Furthermore, the observation of lower water/air fugacity ratios for the more lipophilic PCB congeners suggests that vertical export with particulate organic material can cause a fugacity deficit of lipophilic substances in surface water of the Baltic Sea.},

Samples were analyzed for organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), including three isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and two isomers of heptachlor epoxide. The gaseous total HCH ({$\Sigma$}HCHs) concentrations were approximately four times lower (average 12.0~pg~m               -3               ) than those measured during CHINARE2008 (average 51.4~pg~m               -3               ), but were comparable to those measured during CHINARE2003 (average 13.4~pg~m               -3               ) in the same study area. These changes are consistent with the evident retreat of sea ice coverage from 2003 to 2008 and increase of sea ice coverage from 2008 to 2009 and 2010. Gaseous               {$\beta$}               -HCH concentrations in the atmosphere were typically below the method detection limit, consistent with the expectation that ocean currents provide the main transport pathway for               {$\beta$}               -HCH into the Arctic.

We present an overview of studies on PCBs in the Arctic and combine these with the findings from ArcRisk{\textemdash}a major European Union-funded project aimed at examining the effects of climate change on the transport of contaminants to and their behaviour of in the Arctic{\textemdash}to provide a case study on the behaviour and impact of PCBs over time in the Arctic. PCBs in the Arctic have shown declining trends in the environment over the last few decades. Atmospheric long-range transport from secondary and primary sources is the major input of PCBs to the Arctic region. Modelling of the atmospheric PCB composition and behaviour showed some increases in environmental concentrations in a warmer Arctic, but the general decline in PCB levels is still the most prominent feature. `Within-Arctic' processing of PCBs will be affected by climate change-related processes such as changing wet deposition. These in turn will influence biological exposure and uptake of PCBs. The pan-Arctic rivers draining large Arctic/sub-Arctic catchments provide a significant source of PCBs to the Arctic Ocean, although changes in hydrology/sediment transport combined with a changing marine environment remain areas of uncertainty with regard to PCB fate. Indirect effects of climate change on human exposure, such as a changing diet will influence and possibly reduce PCB exposure for indigenous peoples. Body burdens of PCBs have declined since the 1980s and are predicted to decline further.},

Here, surface seawater PCB concentrations and congener fingerprints are evaluated for all seven pan-Arctic shelf seas and for the interior basins. Particulate and dissolved PCBs were collected via trace-clean protocols onPthree basin-wide expeditions (AO-01, Beringia-2005, and ISSS-08). Concentrations of the sum of 13 abundant congeners ( 13PCB) were 0.13-21 pg/L, with higher concentrations in the shelf seas and lower concentrations in the Central Arctic Basin. Trichlorinated PCBs constituted about half of the total loadings in the Eastern Arctic (Beaufort, Chukchi, East Siberian, and Laptev Seas) and in the Central Basin, indicating an atmospheric source. In contrast, hexachlorinated PCBs were more abundant than tri-PCBs in the western sector, suggesting a rolePalso for waterborne transport from regions of heavy PCB consumption in North America and Europe. Finally, the inventory of 13PCB in the polar mixed layer of the entire Arctic Ocean was 0.39 ton, which implies that only 0.0008\% of historical PCB emissions are now residing in Arctic surface waters.},

  abstract = {Many legacy and emerging persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been reported in polar regions, and act as sentinels of global pollution. Maritime Antarctica is recipient of abundant snow precipitation. Snow scavenges air pollutants, and after snow melting, it can induce an unquantified and poorly understood amplification of concentrations of POPs. Air, snow, the fugacity in soils and snow, seawater and plankton were sampled concurrently from late spring to late summer at Livingston Island (Antarctica). Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) concentrations in snow and air were close to equilibrium. POPs in soils showed concentrations close to soil-air equilibrium or net volatilization depending on chemical volatility. Seawater-air fugacity ratios were highly correlated with the product of the snow-air partition coefficient and the Henry's law constant (KSA H'), a measure of snow amplification of fugacity. Therefore, coastal seawater mirrored the PCB congener profile and increased concentrations in snowmelt due to snowpack releasing POPs to seawater. The influence of snowpack and glacier inputs was further evidenced by the correlation between net volatilization fluxes of PCBs and seawater salinity. A meta-analysis of KSA, estimated as the ratio of POP concentrations in snow and air from previously reported simultaneous field measurements, showed that snow amplification is relevant for diverse families of POPs, independent of their volatility. We claim that the potential impact of atmospheric pollution on aquatic ecosystems has been under-predicted by only considering air-water partitioning, as snow amplification influences, and may even control, the POP occurrence in cold environments.},

We determined sixty-six compounds, including polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DLPCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), as well as polychlorinated diphenyl ethers (PCDEs), polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs), and polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), in air samples simultaneously collected from the offshore oceanic atmosphere (n = 6) and over a rural area (n = 2). We calculated the atmospheric World Health Organization 2005 toxic equivalency levels (WHO2005-TEQ), for the total dioxin-like POPs, including PCDD/Fs, DLPCBs, and PBDD/Fs, being 0.00612 pg WHO2005-TEQ/m3 and 0.0138 pg WHO2005-TEQ/m3 over the ocean and land, respectively. We found unexpected lower averaged atmospheric PBDE concentrations in the rural area (15.9 pg/m3) than over the ocean (31.1 pg/m3) due to higher levels of the BDE209 congener, although the difference was not statistically significant. We have compared and reported our field results with previously published datasets over the global oceans, which suggest PCBs and PBDEs are the dominant chemical contaminants in the global oceanic atmosphere among these halogenated POPs (e.g. PCBs and {$\Sigma$}di-hepta PBDEs could be found in the range of 0.09{\textendash}48.7 and 8.07{\textendash}94.0 pg/m3, respectively, including our dataset). However, there are still very few investigations on the global atmospheric levels of PBDD/Fs, PCDEs and PBBs and our data sums to these earlier studies. Finally, we point out that the halogenated POPs originated from Taiwan or the continental East Asia which could easily reach remote ocean sites via atmospheric transport.},

  abstract = {Using the North Sea as a case scenario, a combined three-dimensional hydrodynamic-biogeochemical-pollutant model was applied for simulating the seasonal variability of the distribution of hydrophobic chemical pollutants in a marine water body. The model was designed in a nested framework including a hydrodynamic block (Hamburg Shelf Ocean Model (HAMSOM)), a biogeochemical block (Oxygen Depletion Model (OxyDep)), and a pollutant-partitioning block (PolPar). Pollutants can be (1) transported via advection and turbulent diffusion, (2) get absorbed and released by a dynamic pool of particulate and dissolved organic matter, and (3) get degraded. Our model results indicate that the seasonality of biogeochemical processes, including production, sinking, and decay, favors the development of hot spots with particular high pollutant concentrations in intermediate waters of biologically highly active regions and seasons, and it potentially increases the exposure of feeding fish to these pollutants. In winter, however, thermal convection homogenizes the water column and destroys the vertical stratification of the pollutant. A significant fraction of the previously exported pollutants is then returned to the water surface and becomes available for exchange with the atmosphere, potentially turning the ocean into a secondary source for pollutants. Moreover, we could show that desorption from aging organic material in the upper aphotic zone is expected to retard pollutants transfer and burial into sediments; thus, it is considerably limiting the effectiveness of the biological pump for pollutant exports.},

Particularly, POPs content in pelagic and demersal fish of different size classes (small, medium, and large) were estimated, starting from the measured seawater and sediments concentrations, using the KABAM model. In particular, Monte Carlo simulation techniques were applied to address uncertainty in assessment of the risk and to provide quantitative estimates of probability of exposition. Ingestion of contaminated pelagic and demersal fish was the dominant pathway of exposition with high probability of significant cancer risk (Ingestion Cancer Risk {$>$}10-4) and significant non-cancer risk (Hazard Index {$>$}1). No human health risks emerged to be associated to dermal adsorption from contaminated seawater. Benzo(a)pyrene show the highest Ingestion Cancer Risk with respect to the other PAHs, while the highest Hazard Index for non-cancerogenic molecules was estimated for the PBDE47 congener.},

Environmental monitoring has been performed since then, but background levels are scarce or absent to Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), making impact assessments difficult. In the current study, we presented the baseline levels, inventories, and risk assessment of the POPs polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) and organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs), in surface sediment of the DRM. Samples were collected in December 2010 and July 2011, i.e., four years before the Fund{\~a}o dam failure. The total PCBs and the OCPs (Aldrin, HCHs, and Chlordanes) were detected in both sampling campaigns, with levels up to 9.50 and 1.64, 0.28, and 0.63 ng g-1, respectively. The decrease of the Doce River flow was the main factor contributing to seasonal variations in the spatial distribution, and to a slight decline in the levels and frequency of the analyzed POPs in sediments collected in the dry season (July 2011). Environmental risk assessment, inventories, and total mass results suggest a low potential of PCBs and OCPs accumulation before the dam failure. This is the first POPs assessment in the study area that helped identify some unexpected impacts of the Fund{\~a}o dam failure and contributed to the understanding of POPs cycles in the Southern Atlantic, data that are still scarce in the region.},

The contaminant distribution pattern indicated that agrochemical sources were more important than industrial sources, and that historical residues remain the primary source of OCs in Weizhou Island. Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) indicated that dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes was bioaccumulating with log BAFs ranging from 3.53 to 5.21. Some congeners diverged from the general trend predicted by the logarithm octanol-water partition coefficient (log Kow); this was mainly attributable to differences in the bioaccumulation potentials of these congeners in the studied samples. Trophic magnification factors demonstrated that aldrin, endrin, and dieldrin undergo significant trophic dilution, while the other six OC compounds undergo trophic magnification in the food chain. The presence of OCP congeners was also probably affected by their metabolism in fish tissues. The estimated daily intakes of OCPs via fish consumption by residents ranged from 0.05 to 5.45 ng/kg body weight/day, which is below the acceptable daily intake recommended by the FAO/WHO.},

  abstract = {The aim of the study was the assessment of Cystoseira phytocenosis role as a biological barrier in cleaning of seawater in the SPNA Cape Martyan marine area against its pollution with heavy metals (HM: V, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Hg, Mo, Ag, Cd, Sb, Pb) and organochlorine compounds (OCC: DDT, DDE, DDD, {$\Sigma$}DDT, PCB 28, PCB 52, PCB 101, PCB 138, PCB 153, PCB 180). It was deduced that the significant role of Cystoseira phytocenosis in extraction of HM (from 9 to 99\%) and of OCC (from 55 to 96\%) from the aquatic environment is determined by its high specific biomass (up to 4.6 kg{$\cdot$}m-2) and accumulating ability against pollutants with concentration factors of n{\texttimes}(102{$\div$}105) for HM and n{\texttimes}(102{$\div$}103) for OCC. Resulting from the Cystoseira production processes, extraction of pollutants from biotope by the algae amounted to 0.1{$\div$}967.6 kg{$\cdot$}y-1 for HM and 0.044{$\div$}8.360 g{$\cdot$}y-1. It was shown that the most optimal way of recreational zones quality management regarding marine environment pollution factor is the maintenance of the coastal Cystoseira phytocenoses and taking of measures increasing their dispersion and production indices.},

  abstract = {We analyzed three decades of field observations in the North Sea with additive models to infer spatiotemporal trends of chlorophyll a concentration, sediment organic carbon content, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) concentrations in mussels and sediments. By doing so, we separated long-term changes in PCB concentrations from seasonal variability. Using the inferred seasonal variability, we demonstrated that phytoplankton blooms in spring and autumn correspond to the annual maxima of the organic carbon content (r = 0.56; p = 0.004) and the PCB concentrations in sediments (r = 0.57; p = 0.004). Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between the PCB concentrations in sediments and in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis; r = -0.33, p = 0.012), which is probably related to the cleansing of the dissolved PCB phase driven by sinking organic matter during phytoplankton blooms and the filter-feeding behavior of the blue mussel. The present research demonstrates the role of seasonal phytoplankton dynamics in the environmental fate of PCBs at large spatiotemporal scales.},

  abstract = {Gaseous and dissolved concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were measured in the ambient air and water of Kaohsiung Harbor lagoon, Taiwan, from December 2003 to January 2005. During the rainy season (April to September), gaseous PCB and HCB concentrations were low due to both scavenging by precipitation and dilution by prevailing southwesterly winds blown from the atmosphere of the South China Sea. In contrast, trace precipitation and prevailing northeasterly winds during the dry season (October to March) resulted in higher gaseous PCB and HCB concentrations. Instantaneous air{\textendash}water exchange fluxes of PCB homologues and HCB were calculated from 22 pairs of air and water samples from Kaohsiung Harbor lagoon. All net fluxes of PCB homologues and HCB in this study are from water to air (net volatilization). The highest net volatile flux observed was +172 ng m-2 day- 1 (dichlorobiphenyls) in December, 2003 due to the high wind speed and high dissolved concentration. The PCB homologues and HCB fluxes were significantly governed by dissolved concentrations in Kaohsiung Harbor lagoon. For low molecular weight PCBs (LMW PCBs), their fluxes were also significantly correlated with wind speed. The net PCB and HCB fluxes suggest that the annual sums of 69 PCBs and HCB measured in this study were mainly volatile (57.4 {\texttimes} 103 and 28.3 {\texttimes} 103 ng m-2 yr- 1, respectively) and estimated yearly, 1.5 kg and 0.76 kg of PCBs and HCB were emitted from the harbor lagoon surface waters to the ambient atmosphere. The average tPCB flux in this study was about one-tenth of tPCB fluxes seen in New York Harbor and in the Delaware River, which are reported to be greatly impacted by PCBs.},

  abstract = {The Arctic is generally considered to be a pristine environment and has few direct inputs of organochlorine compounds (OCs), including pesticides, herbicides, polychlorinated biphenyls, or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In spite of this, airborne concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are comparable to those in more populated and industrialized regions of North America and Europe. Atmospheric transport and condensation of compounds at low temperature conditions are important factors contributing to the presence of contaminants in the Arctic. A long-term program has been established to measure the airborne concentrations of POPs in the Arctic. The first station at Alert was established in January 1992. The concentrations measured in the first year of monitoring for 18 compounds that are representative of different compound classes are presented. Seasonal variations for PAHs are similar to those for Arctic haze and peak during winter. For example, in the coldest period, October to April, benzo[a]pyrene concentrations were found to average 20 pg/m3, whereas, in contrast, during the relatively warm May to September period, average levels were 1.0 pg/m3. For OCs, the seasonal cycle was not as pronounced as that for PAH compounds. For example, ␣-hexachlorocyclohexane was found at Alert at average concentrations of 62 and 57 pg/m3, respectively, during cold and warm periods. It is postulated that air concentrations are influenced by advection from distant source regions as well as exchange with local (Arctic Ocean) surfaces.},

This study reports the gas- and aerosol-phase concentrations of a-HCH, g-HCH, and HCB in the atmosphere from the Weddell, South Scotia and Bellingshausen Seas. The atmospheric samples were obtained in two sampling cruises in 2008 and 2009, and in a third sampling campaign at Livingston Island (2009) in order to quantify the potential secondary sources of HCHs and HCB due to volatilization from Antarctic soils and snow. The gas phase concentrations of HCHs and HCB are low, and in the order of very few pg m{\`A}3 aHCH and g-HCH concentrations were higher when the air mass back trajectory was coming from the Antarctic continent, consistent with net volatilization fluxes of g-HCH measured at Livingston Island being a significant secondary source to the regional atmosphere. In addition, the Southern ocean is an important net sink of HCHs, and to minor extent of HCB, due to high diffusive air-to-water fluxes. These net absorption fluxes for HCHs are presumably due to the role of bacterial degradation, depleting the water column concentrations of HCHs in surface waters and driving an airewater disequilibrium. This is the first field study that has investigated the coupling between the atmospheric occurrence of HCHs and HCB, the simultaneous airewater exchange, soil/snow-air exchange, and long range transport of organic pollutants in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.},

Concentrations of HCHs and HCB were measured simultaneously in the atmosphere (gas and aerosol phases), seawater (dissolved and particulate phases), and phytoplankton. The atmospheric concentrations of HCHs decrease during transport over the Greenland Current with estimated e-folding times of 1.6 days, a trend not observed for HCB. This strong decrease in atmospheric concentrations of HCH is consistent with the estimated atmospheric depositional fluxes driven by the air-water disequilibrium. The removal of HCHs from the surface ocean by the degradative pump due to hydrolysis and microbial degradation and by the biological pump due to settling of particle-associated HCHs are estimated; the removal fluxes are within a factor of 2 of the atmospheric inputs for most sampling events, suggesting an important role of the degradative pump in the overall oceanic sink of HCHs. Conversely, the lack of degradation of HCB in surface waters and its relatively low hydrophobicity imply a lack of effective removal processes, consistent with the observed air and water concentrations close to equilibrium. This work is the first that estimates the relative importance of the biological and degradative pumps on the atmospheric deposition of the less persistent organic pollutants and points out the need for further research for quantifying the magnitude of degradative processes in the environment.},

  abstract = {The Southern Ocean is one of the most pristine environments in the world, but is nonetheless affected by inputs of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). In the present work, we report the concentrations of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and 26 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) congeners in seawater and phytoplankton from samples obtained during three Antarctic cruises in 2005, 2008, and 2009. The levels of PCBs, HCHs, and HCB are low in comparison to the few previous reports for this region and studies from other oceans. The long-term decline of POP concentrations in the Southern Ocean seawater since early 1980 is consistent with half-lives of 3.4 and 5.7 years for HCHs and PCBs, respectively. There is a large variability of PCBs, HCHs, and HCB concentrations in water and phytoplankton within the Bransfield Strait, South Scotia, Weddell, and Bellingshausen Seas that masks the differences between the studied Seas. However, the variability of PCBs concentrations in phytoplankton is significantly correlated with phytoplankton biomass, with lower concentrations in the most productive waters. This trend is more apparent for the more hydrophobic congeners, consistent with the role of settling fluxes of organic matter decreasing the concentrations of hydrophobic POPs in productive waters. The present work reports the most extensive data set on concentrations in seawater and phytoplankton for the Southern Ocean, and points to the important biogeochemical drivers, such as settling and degradation, influencing the occurrence of POPs in the ocean.},

Endosulfan sulfate was predominant in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas isomer I was more abundant in the Southern Hemisphere. Endosulfan was detected in the atmosphere over the western Pacific Ocean but rarely in the central Arctic and North Atlantic oceans. Its concentration in seawater increased with increasing latitude in the Southern Ocean. Although fugacity ratios indicate a strong potential for deposition of endosulfan, air-seawater exchange may be slow, as suggested by the large differences between atmospheric and seawater concentrations. Ocean current endosulfan loads varied markedly between seasons. Three-day backward trajectories indicate that Northeast Asia is the major source of atmospheric endosulfan in the western Pacific Ocean, whereas the central Arctic and North Atlantic oceans are affected more by local air masses.},

In this research, an approach of coupling aquatic time-integrated passive sampling with chemical analysis and bioassays was used to assess pollution by hydrophobic organic contaminants in Antarctic waters. Passive samplers were deployed in waters of Fildes Peninsula, Antarctica, and their extracts were used for chemical analyses of sixty-six hydrophobic organic contaminants belonging to five groups [organophosphorus flame retardants (PFRs), phthalic acid esters (PAEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)] and in vitro bioassays for endocrine disruption and genotoxicity. In total, twenty pollutants (six PFRs, one PAE, two PAHs, six OCPs, and five PCBs) were quantified, and six PFRs had concentrations that ranged from ND (not detected) to 44.37 ng L{\`A}1 in Antarctic waters. The concentrations detected in the waters were generally low and insufficient to have significant in vitro endocrine disruption potential or genotoxicity. The source and transport pathways of PFRs and PAE in Fildes Peninsula were studied, and multiple local sources (wastewater, air traffic, research stations, and animal feces) for different PFRs were proposed. A spatial and temporal analysis showed slight changes in the exposure of OCPs and PCBs in Antarctic waters. Furthermore, a comparison among a variety of Antarctic water sampling cases revealed that passive sampling can be a tool for aquatic time-integrated investigations in polar regions.},

  abstract = {Distributions of eight targeted current-use pesticides (CUPs) chloroneb, simazine, atrazine, alachlor, dacthal, chlorobenzilate, methoxychlor, and permethrin were investigated in seawater and the atmosphere in a region covering the North Pacific to the Arctic Oceans during the 7th and 8th Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition (2016 and 2017) voyages of the research vessel R/V Xuelong (Snow Dragon in English). Total CUP concentrations in seawater have prominent seasonal and latitudinal trends, with higher concentrations occurring at lower latitudes in early summer. The major contributors of the CUPs ({$\sum$}8CUP) did not alter over different seasons with dominant chloroneb, alachlor, and atrazine accounting for more than 90\%, but their concentrations did have marked seasonal changes. However, the compositions of the eight analyzed CUPs varied indistinctly between seasons indicating a possible combined environmental impact on these compounds rather than the effects of individual chemical properties. Three-day backward air mass trajectories indicate that atmospheric masses from northeastern China are responsible for the high concentrations of CUPs in East China and Japan Seas, whereas those from the North Atlantic Ocean contribute to the low levels in local area. Fugacity ratios indicate potential volatilization and equilibrium of chloroneb in the Canada Basin of the Arctic Ocean and Japan Sea, respectively, and deposition of other CUPs in both regions. However, atmospheric concentrations are decoupled from those in seawater, which indicates a low exchange rate.},

  abstract = {Over 50 seawater samples from two different sites{\textemdash}Barcelona (Spain) and Banyuls-sur-Mer (France){\textemdash}were analyzed in order to study the extent and postulate the processes driving the enrichment of hydrophobic organic pollutants in the sea surface microlayer (SML). A number of individual polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners (41) were measured to study their partitioning between the particulate (fraction N 0.7 Am) and the dissolved + colloidal phases (fraction b 0.7 Am), with the latter being differentiated into estimated dissolved and colloidal phases. In addition, several organochlorine pesticides were also measured, namely, HCB, a-HCH, g-HCH, 4,4V-DDE, 4,4V-DDD and 4,4V-DDT. The presence of PCB congener profiles found in the SML suggests a dynamic coupling with the atmosphere in Banyuls sampling site, whereas offshore Barcelona the presence of highly chlorinated congeners was due to persistent sediment resuspension. The average PCB concentration in the SML dissolved + colloidal phase were higher in Banyuls (7.8 ng L{\`A} 1) than in Barcelona (3.6 ng L{\`A} 1) samples, but in the particulate phase concentrations were higher in Barcelona (3.2 ng L{\`A} 1) to that of Banyuls (1.4 ng L{\`A} 1). However, PCB concentrations in the SML generally also showed large variability. Enrichment factors of PCBs and other organochlorine compounds in the SML with respect to the underlying water column ranged from 0.2 to 7.4. This may be explained for both the dissolved + colloidal and particulate phases by the enrichment in the SML of organic carbon (OC) as discerned from particle{\textendash}water and colloid{\textendash}water partitioning.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric (gaseous and particulate) and seawater (dissolved and particulate in the surface microlayer and underlying waters) samples were collected in 2001 and 2002 in two North-Western Mediterranean contrasting coastal environments, Banyuls-sur-Mer (France) and Barcelona (Spain). The total aerosol suspended particle concentrations (lg m{\`A}3) were higher in Barcelona (266 {$\pm$} 132) than in Banyuls-sur-Mer (149 {$\pm$} 43), even under near-gale conditions. The influence of the marine aerosol in the total suspended particles (TSP) concentration was backed by both organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) concentrations, as they exhibited lower levels in Banyuls (3 {$\pm$} 2 lg OC m{\`A}3 and 0.4 {$\pm$} 0.3 lg EC m{\`A}3) than in Barcelona (31 {$\pm$} 26 lg OC m{\`A}3 and 6 {$\pm$} 8 lg EC m{\`A}3). Moreover, samples from Barcelona, both atmospheric and seawater, showed greater variability than in Banyuls (Snedecor's test (p {$<$} 0.001)) possibly reflecting the influence of urban sources of pollutants. Concentrations of atmospheric PCBs (R41 congeners) offshore Barcelona ranged from 389 to 1410 pg m{\`A}3 in the gas phase and from 71 to 78 pg m{\`A}3 in the aerosol phase. In Banyuls, concentrations were 30.7{\textendash}858 pg m{\`A}3 in the gas phase and 12.8{\textendash}41.2 pg m{\`A}3 in the aerosol phase. Their gas-particle partitioning suggested that PCBs in the samples were close to equilibrium (deduced from the regression of the experimental log Kp and log P0l ). Moreover, a positive correlation was found between wind direction, wind speed and atmospheric PCB concentrations, which is consistent with the fact the PCB concentration of the marine waters, influenced by coastal run-off, become a secondary source for these semi-volatile compounds after volatilization to the coastal atmosphere. This is supported by the high dissolved concentrations in the coastal surface waters, and specially by the enrichment found in the surface microlayer.},

Gas phase, particle phase and precipitation concentrations of 22 OCP species, including chlordanes, DDTs, HCHs, endosulfan I and II, aldrin and diedrin, were measured. OCPs are found predominantly in the gas phase in all seasons, representing over 95\% of the total air concentrations. Most of the pesticides measured display highest concentrations at urban sites (Camden and New Brunswick), although in many cases the differences in geometric mean concentrations are not statistically significant. The relationship of gas-phase partial pressure with temperature was examined using the Clausius{\textendash}Clapeyron equation; significant temperature dependencies were found for all OCPs, except aldrin. Atmospheric depositional fluxes (gas absorption into water+dry particle deposition+wet deposition) to the New York{\textendash}New Jersey Harbor Estuary of selected OCPs were estimated at NJADN sites. Atmospheric concentrations of dieldrin, aldrin and the HCHs are similar to those measured by the Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network (IADN) in the Great Lake Region. In contrast, concentrations of DDTs, chlordanes and heptachlor are higher in the Mid-Atlantic compared to the Great Lakes, suggesting that the New York{\textendash}New Jersey Harbor Estuary receives higher fluxes of these chemicals than the Great Lakes.},

The atmospheric concentrations were higher close to the coast and lower in remote regions of the Indian and South Atlantic Ocean. Groups of samples were selected in the South China Sea, Indian Ocean and South Atlantic Ocean where the relative wind direction matched the trajectory of the ship, thus all the samples had the same input of sources upwind. In these three regions the concentrations of OCPs and PCBs declined during atmospheric transport following first order kinetics. These sets of measurements provided estimates of field derived residence times (FDRTs) for individual compounds. These values were compared with predicted atmospheric residence times (PARTs) computed using a model of long-range atmospheric transport potential of POPs. The FDRTs are 5-10 times longer for the more volatile PCB congeners and TC, CC, p,p{${'}$}-DDT and p,p{${'}$}-DDE than the respective PARTs, while they are similar to PARTs for the less volatile compounds. Possible causes of discrepancies between PARTs and FDRTs are discussed, and revolatilization from the ocean surface seems to be the main cause for the higher values of FDRTs of the more volatile compounds in comparison with the respective PARTs.},

Here field-derived               K               aw               values for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners (PCBs 28, 49, 52, 118, 138, 149, and 153) were determined in the open Atlantic Ocean, at locations where air and seawater were assumed to be at equilibrium. Field-based               K               aw               values were derived from air and seawater samples simultaneously collected at these locations, and their relationship with temperature was determined.

Possible causes of differences between the field and the laboratory data may be attributed to differences between pure water and seawater and the use of much higher persistent organic pollutant concentrations in laboratory studies compared to that of the remote ocean.

The air data show a strong decline with latitude with the highest polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations in Europe and the lowest in the Arctic. {$\Sigma$}               ICES               PCBs in air range from 100 pg m               -3               near Norway to 0.8 pg m               -3               in the Arctic. A comparison with other data from previous and ongoing land-based air measurements in the Arctic region suggests no clear temporal decline of PCBs in the European Arctic since the mid-1990s. Dissolved concentrations of {$\Sigma$}               6               PCBs (28/31, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153) in surface seawater were {$<$}1 pg L               -1               . Dominant PCBs in seawater were 28/31 and 52 (0.1{\textendash}0.44 pg L               -1               ), with PCBs 101, 118, and 138 {$<$} 0.1 pg L               -1               . In seawater, PCB 52 displayed the highest concentrations in the northernmost samples, while PCBs 101, 118, and 138 showed slightly decreasing trends with increasing latitude. Fractionation was observed for PCBs in seawater with the relative abundance of PCBs 28 and 52 increasing and that of the heavier congeners decreasing with latitude. However, in air only 15{\textendash}20\% of the variability of atmospheric PCBs can be explained by temperature. Owing to large uncertainties in the Henry's Law constant (HLC) values, fugacity quotients for PCBs were estimated using different HLCs reported in the literature. These indicate that on average, deposition dominates over volatilization for PCBs in the Arctic region with a strong increase in the middle of the transect near the marginal ice zone (78{\textendash}79{\textdegree}N). The increase in fugacity ratio is mainly caused by an increase in air concentration in this region (possibly indirectly caused by ice melting being a source of PCBs to the atmosphere).},

Concentrations of the most abundant compounds (hexachlorocyclohexanes, ex and y-HCH) were higher in air vapour and snow during May than in August consistent with the inferred seasonal maximum of Arctic haze. Cyclodienes (dieldrin, heptachlor epoxide, cis and trans-chlordane) and PCB's (quantified as Aroclor 1254) associated with particles in snow and seawater were also present in highest concentrations in late spring. p,p'-DDT and o,p' and p,p-DDE were detected associated with particles in air, snow and seawater but concentrations were below levels for accurate quantification. Concentrations of dissolved HCH's in seawater in the uniformly mixed upper 50 m (4-5 ng 1- 1) decreased by an order-of-magnitude to 280 m depth. There were no significant differences in vertical profiles for the two sampling periods. Similarities in ratios of HCH and chlordane isomers in air, snow and seawater above JOO m imply that these compounds are transferred between environmental compartments without transformations. Lower ratios below 100 m indicate a different source or selective conversion of specific isomers.},

Of the estimated = 40 000 t {\textasciitilde}PCB sold in the UK since 1954, only an estimated 1\% (400 t) are now present in the UK environment. Comparisons of estimated production and current environmental loadings of congeners 28, 52, 101, 138, 153 and 180 suggest that PCB persistence broadly increases with increasing chlorination. Those PCBs that are not now present in the UK environment are considered to have been destroyed--by natural or anthropogenic mechanisms, to be still in use, to reside in landfills or to have undergone atmospheric and{\textasciitilde}or pelagic" transport from the UK. The dramatic fall in PCB levels in archived UK soils and vegetation between the mid1960s and the present is evidence that the latter mechanism is the most important and that a significant proportion of PCBs released into the UK environment in the 1960s have subsequently undergone environmental transport away from the UK. The bulk (93.1{\textasciitilde}) of the estimated contemporary UK environmental burden of {\textasciitilde}PCBs is associated with soils, with the rest found in seawater (3.5\%) and marine sediments (2.1\%). Freshwater sediments, vegetation, humans and sewage sludge combined account for 1.4\% of the present burden, whilst PCB loadings in air and freshwater are insignificant. Although consideration of individual congeners does not reveal any major deviations from the relative partitioning of {\textasciitilde},PCBs, the importance of sinks other than soils is enhanced for individual congeners, particularly 138 and 180. In particular, around 2\% of the total UK burden of congener 180 is present in humans, implying that biota as a whole mar' constitute an important sink for the higher chlorinated congeners.},

Many samples such as seawater, benthic invertebrates, fishes, Weddell seal etc., were collected at the Tottuki Point where pollution by human activities has been most unlikely and from Syowa Station where some pollution is likely because of the research activities. In seawater samples, the concentration of PCBs (sum of several tens of individual chlorinated biphenyls) was found to be higher than that of .J: DDT (p, p'-DDE+ p, p'-DDT), but reverse in organisms. J; Chlordane (sum of several chlordane compounds and metabolites) concen\- trations showed the middle level between PCBs and J; DDT in both seawater and organisms. In higher trophic level organisms, the bioconcentration factors (BCFs) increased, and variable compositions of PCBs and chlordane compounds were also found. Concentration levels of J; DDT and PCBs in the antarctic marine ecosystem were about two orders of magnitude lower than those in the western North Pacific. The low levels are most likely attributable to the low concentration of these chemicals in seawater under the antarctic fast ice, which might be caused by the specific environmental characteristics in the Antarctic relating to its locality being far away from the intensive regions of industrial and human activities on the earth, the ice covering and the high bioproductivity dur\- ing the austral summer.},

The lack of local sources and remoteness of the region imply long-range transport and deposition of contaminants into the Arctic from sources to the south. While on the third Soviet-American Joint Ecological Expedition to the Bering and Chukchi Seas (August 1988), high-volume air samples were taken and analyzed for Organochlorine pesticides. Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), hexachlorobenzene, polychlorinated camphenes, and chlordane (listed in order of abundance, highest to lowest) were quantified. The air-sea gas exchange of HCH was estimated at 18 stations during the cruise. Average {$\alpha$}-HCH concentrations in concurrent atmosphere and surface water samples were 250 pg m               -3               and 2.4 ng L               -1               , respectively, and average {$\gamma$}-HCH concentrations were 68 pg m               -3               in the atmosphere and 0.6 ng L               -1               in surface water.

The proposed method was employed for field tests which covered large amounts of water samples in the Pearl River Estuary in rainy and dry seasons. The on-site SPME sampling method can avoid the contamination of sample, the losses of analytes during sample transportation, as well as the usage of solvent and time-consuming sample preparation process. Results indicated that the technique with the designed device can address the requirement of modern environment water analysis.

  abstract = {Continuous and comparable atmospheric monitoring programs to study the transport and occurrence of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the atmosphere of remote regions is essential to better understand the global movement of these chemicals and to evaluate the effectiveness of international control measures. Key results from four main Arctic research stations, Alert (Canada), Pallas (Finland), Storhofdi (Iceland) and Zeppelin (Svalbard/Norway), where long-term monitoring have been carried out since the early 1990s, are summarized. We have also included a discussion of main results from various Arctic satellite stations in Canada, Russia, US (Alaska) and Greenland which have been operational for shorter time periods. Using the Digital Filtration temporal trend development technique, it was found that while some POPs showed more or less consistent declines during the 1990s, this reduction is less apparent in recent years at some sites. In contrast, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were still found to be increasing by 2005 at Alert with doubling times of 3.5 years in the case of deca-BDE. Levels and patterns of most POPs in Arctic air are also showing spatial variability, which is typically explained by differences in proximity to suspected key source regions and long-range atmospheric transport potentials. Furthermore, increase in worldwide usage of certain pesticides, e.g. chlorothalonil and quintozene, which are contaminated with hexachlorobenzene (HCB), may result in an increase in Arctic air concentration of HCB. The results combined also indicate that both temporal and spatial patterns of POPs in Arctic air may be affected by various processes driven by climate change, such as reduced ice cover, increasing seawater temperatures and an increase in biomass burning in boreal regions as exemplified by the data from the Zeppelin and Alert stations. Further research and continued air monitoring are needed to better understand these processes and its future impact on the Arctic environment.},

Linkages of such observations to Arctic ecosystem exposure and effects are needed.           ,              Climate change brings about significant changes in the physical environment in the Arctic. Increasing temperatures, sea ice retreat, slumping permafrost, changing sea ice regimes, glacial loss and changes in precipitation patterns can all affect how contaminants distribute within the Arctic environment and subsequently impact the Arctic ecosystems. In this review, we summarized observed evidence of the influence of climate change on contaminant circulation and transport among various Arctic environment media, including air, ice, snow, permafrost, fresh water and the marine environment. We have also drawn on parallel examples observed in Antarctica and the Tibetan Plateau, to broaden the discussion on how climate change may influence contaminant fate in similar cold-climate ecosystems. Significant knowledge gaps on indirect effects of climate change on contaminants in the Arctic environment, including those of extreme weather events, increase in forests fires, and enhanced human activities leading to new local contaminant emissions, have been identified. Enhanced mobilization of contaminants to marine and freshwater ecosystems has been observed as a result of climate change, but better linkages need to be made between these observed effects with subsequent exposure and accumulation of contaminants in biota. Emerging issues include those of Arctic contamination by microplastics and higher molecular weight halogenated natural products (hHNPs) and the implications of such contamination in a changing Arctic environment is explored.},

The atmospheric decline rate of the same congener also varied from site to site. To determine whether these site-specific variations in atmospheric trends of PCB concentrations are controlled by changes in primary emissions or various removal processes in the environment (transfer to deep sea, freshwater sediment burial, reaction with OH radicals, degradation in media other than air), the measured trends are compared to those simulated by a zonally averaged global fate and transport model using historical emission estimates and realistic and hypothetical environmental scenarios. The modelled decline rates of a specific congener in both the North Polar and the North Temperate zones are similar and mimic closely those of the historical emission estimates fed into the model, suggesting that the rate of decline of PCB air concentrations during the 1990s was mostly driven by declines in primary emission. This implies that measured air concentration data reflect primary PCB emissions as long as these continue. Under the assumption that primary emission completely ceased after 2001, the model predicted that the terrestrial surface media would eventually become the only major global PCB reservoir, and the rate of concentration decline in air then depends solely on that in soil. Also, primary emissions and volatilization from soil, respectively, are the primary input to the atmosphere before and after primary emissions stopped. The model further illustrates that even during periods when primary emissions still dominate PCB air concentrations temperature-driven cycles of air/surface exchange may be observed. Large scale redistribution of PCBs by the grass-hopper effect can thus also occur while primary emissions are still dominant.},

Distribution patterns of organochlorines in sediments showed smaller spatial variations on global terms, indicating that the chemicals released in the tropical environment are dispersed rapidly through air and water and retahwd less in sediments. The ratios of organochlorine concentrations in sediment and water phases were positively correlated with the latitude of sampling, suggesting that persistent and semivolatile compounds discharged in the tropics tend to be redistributed on a global scale.},

Here we report the time trends and air-water exchange of OCPs and CUPs from research expeditions conducted between 1993 and 2013. Compounds determined in both air and water were trans- and cischlordanes (TC, CC), trans- and cis-nonachlors (TN, CN), heptachlor exo-epoxide (HEPX), dieldrin (DIEL), chlorobornanes ({$\Sigma$}CHBs and toxaphene), dacthal (DAC), endosulfans and metabolite endosulfan sulfate (ENDO-I, ENDO-II, and ENDO SUL), chlorothalonil (CHT), chlorpyrifos (CPF), and trifluralin (TFN). Pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB and quintozene) and its soil metabolite pentachlorothianisole (PCTA) were also found in air. Concentrations of most OCPs declined in surface water, whereas some CUPs increased (ENDO-I, CHT, and TFN) or showed no significant change (CPF and DAC), and most compounds declined in air. Chlordane compound fractions TC/(TC + CC) and TC/(TC + CC + TN) decreased in water and air, while CC/(TC + CC + TN) increased. TN/(TC + CC + TN) also increased in air and slightly, but not significantly, in water. These changes suggest selective removal of more labile TC and/or a shift in chlordane sources. Water-air fugacity ratios indicated net volatilization (FR {$>$} 1.0) or near equilibrium (FR not significantly different from 1.0) for most OCPs but net deposition (FR {$<$} 1.0) for {$\Sigma$}CHBs. Net deposition was shown for ENDO-I on all expeditions, while the net exchange direction of other CUPs varied. Understanding the processes and current state of air-surface exchange helps to interpret environmental exposure and evaluate the effectiveness of international protocols and provides insights for the environmental fate of new and emerging chemicals.},

The a-HCH concentrations in air and surface water were much lower than in Arctic regions, consistent with the historically lower usage of technical HCH in the Southern Hemisphere. The water/air fugacity ratios of a-HCH were p1.0, indicating steady state or net deposition conditions. The a-HCH in water was enantioselectively metabolized, with resulting enantiomer fractions (EFs) that differed from the racemic (0.500) value of the technical product. The EFs decreased from 40.500 at the lower latitudes to o0.500 farther south, indicating preferential loss of ({\`A})a-HCH or (+)a-HCH in different ocean regions.

Spatial differences in concentration were found that varied with the pesticide. Heptachlor exo-epoxide (a metabolite of heptachlor) and ␣hexachlorocyclohexane (␣-HCH) increased from the Chukchi Sea to the pole, and then decreased toward Spitsbergen and Greenland Sea. Chlorinated bornanes (toxaphene) followed a similar trend, but levels were also high near Spitsbergen and in the Greenland Sea. A reverse trend was found for endosulfan, with lower concentrations in the ice-covered regions. Little variation was seen in chlordane concentrations, although the ratio of trans-/cis-chlordane decreased at high latitudes. Several of these pesticides are chiral: ␣-HCH, cis- and trans-chlordane, and heptachlor exo-epoxide. Enantioselective degradation of (Ϫ)␣-HCH was found in the Bering and Chukchi seas, whereas the (ϩ) enantiomer was depleted in the Arctic Ocean and Greenland Sea. Enrichment of (ϩ) heptachlor exo-epoxide was found in all regions. Trans- and cis-chlordane were nearly racemic.},

The samples were analyzed for organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) to determine their seasonal variation and potential sources over the coastal marine environment. The concentrations of individual OCPs in the PM2.5 samples were higher in winter and lower in summer, and the reverse trend was observed for the measured OCP compounds (except hexachlorocyclohexanes, HCHs) in the gaseous phase. Principal component analysis revealed one trend that contributed 40\% to PM2.5-bound OCPs characterized by b-HCH, a-HCH, p,p0-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (p,p0-DDD), p,p0-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p0-DDE), and chlordanes; whereas two seasonal trends, represented by dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) or chlordanes and HCHs, were responsible for 38\% and 23\% of the gaseous OCPs, respectively. Continental outflow driven by the East Asian monsoon brought large quantities of particulate OCPs to the ECS, especially in winter. Possible fresh sources or net volatilization from the Yangtze River induced by both higher ambient temperature and higher discharge rates caused the higher gaseous DDT and chlordane levels observed in summer. However, the lower concentrations of gaseous HCHs observed in summer suggested that net volatilization had a relatively limited impact on gaseous HCHs due to the long-term prohibition of their use and their low residual levels in the catchment, whereas the elevated concentrations of gaseous HCHs in winter controlled by gaseparticle partitioning, resulted from increased particulate HCHs producing a partial shift to gaseous HCHs over ECS. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Contamination levels were more constant expressed per water volume than per dry weight, and seven times lower (1.2pg m.') than in northern temperate zones (8.8pm3in the North Sea). The Antarctic ecosystems are thus less contaminated than temperate ones -as expected -but the very low phytoplankton biomasspresent cause high PCB levels per unit of biomass. These resultsconfirm the necessity of using different systems of units in order to correctly express the contamination levels and to identify the main mechanisms responsible for the accumulation of stable pollutants.

A kinetic method was developed to obtain KDOCw that required a shorter experimental time than equilibrium methods. The equilibrium partition coefficients of four polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (2,4,40-trichlorobiphenyl (PCB 28), 2,20,3,50-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 44), 2,20,4,5,50-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 101), and 2,20,4,40,5,50-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 153)) between dissolved organic carbon and seawater (KDOCsw) were determined using seawater samples from the Korean coast. The log KDOCsw values of PCB 28 were measured by equilibrating PCB 28, the least hydrophobic congener, with seawater samples, and the values ranged from 6.60 to 7.20. For the more hydrophobic PCBs (PCB 44, PCB 101, and PCB 153), kinetic experiments were conducted to determine the sorption rate constants (k2) and their log KDOCsw values were obtained by comparing their k2 with that of PCB 28. The calculated log KDOCsw values were 6.57e7.35 for PCB 44, 6.23e7.44 for PCB 101, and 6.35e7.73 for PCB 153. The validity of the proposed method was further confirmed using three less hydrophobic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. This kinetic method shortened the experimental time to obtain the KDOCsw values of the more hydrophobic PCBs, which did not reach phase equilibrium.},

  abstract = {To capture the pollutant distribution status among environmental media and to understand how the distribution varies with the pollutants' properties, we assessed a total of 225 fugacity ratios (FRs) of 45 semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PCDDs/Fs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), phthalates, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)) for five medium pairs (air-water, air-soil, water-sediment, soil-water, and soil-sediment) using the nationwide multimedia monitoring data. For many of the pollutants, fugacity was greatest in air (PCDFs and 6 heavy PAHs) and in sediment (PBDEs and 9 light PAHs) while lowest in soil for most of the pollutants. PAHs and phthalates appeared to be farther away from equilibrium than PCDDs/Fs and PBDEs. The ratios of ``equilibrium improbable'' FRs to all the FRs in each chemical group were 2\%, 0\%, 33.3\%, and 28.9\% for PCDDs/Fs, PBDEs, phthalates, and PAHs, respectively. FRwater/air of PAHs, FRsoil/air, and FRsediment/water of the pollutant groups (except for PBDEs) decreased significantly (p b 0.01) with the partition coefficients, 1/Kair/water (1/Kaw), Koctanol/air (Koa), and Koctanol/water (Kow), respectively, even in the field conditions. The findings on FRs values provide valuable clues to identifying the media that would act as sink or source for certain chemicals and to using a more appropriate choice in the coherence test of environmental quality objectives, which should be important considerations in the management of chemical contamination in the environment.},

  abstract = {A mussel and seawater monitoring survey was conducted at six sampling points between Yalikoy (Ordu) and Sinop in 1999{\textendash}2000 along the Mid-Black Sea Coast of Turkey in order to assess concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (OCs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Chlorinated pesticides and PCBs were measured in the mussel Mytilus Galloprovincialis and in seawater. In the mussel samples, the most common pollutants in terms of average concentration per g of wet weight (ww), were DDT (max. 1800 pg/ g ww, min. 240 pg/g ww) and its metabolites DDD (max. 5400 pg/g ww, min. 240 pg/g ww) and DDE (max. 2800 pg/g ww, min. 70 pg/g ww). Also, dieldrin, heptachlor and HCB were notable contaminants in the mussel samples. PCBs were determined in none of the biota or seawater samples. The concentrations of the OCs and PCBs in mussels were higher in coastal areas receiving river discharges and close to the largest city of the region, Samsun (especially in sampling points in the harbour area). The well-known long persistence of DDTs and other chlorinated compounds was confirmed by residues of these pollutants measured in mussels. On the other hand, even though the usage of such kind of persistent compounds in Turkey was banned, there may still be illegal usage and it is not certain whether the application of these compounds did end in the region.},

Samples were analyzed for organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) to assess their distribution patterns, the role of ocean in the long-range transport (LRT), and the air-water exchange directions in the open Pacific Ocean. Such open ocean studies can yield useful information such as establishing temporal and spatial trends and assessing primary vs secondary emissions of legacy OCPs. Target compounds included hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and its derivatives, and chlordane compounds. Concentrations for a-HCH, g-HCH, trans-chlordane (TC), and cis-chlordane (CC) were higher in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) than the Southern Hemisphere (SH) in both gaseous and dissolved phases, while the distribution patterns of DDTs and heptachlor exo-epoxide (HEPX) showed a reversed pattern. In the N Pacific, concentrations of a-HCH and g-HCH in the present work were lower by 63 and 16 times than those observed in 1989e1990. The distribution patterns of DDT suggested there was usage in the SH around 2006. Calculated fugacity ratios suggested that g-HCH was volatilizing from surface water to the atmosphere, and the air-water exchange fluxes were 0.3e11.1 ng m{\`A}2 day{\`A}1. This is the first field study that reported the open Pacific Ocean has become the secondary source for g-HCH and implied that ocean could affect LRT of OCPs by supplying these compounds via air-sea exchange.},

  abstract = {The Yangtze River Estuary (YRE) is strongly influenced by the Yangtze River and lies on the pathway of the East Asian Monsoon. This study examined atmospheric deposition and air-sea gas exchange fluxes of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) to determine whether the YRE is a sink or source of selected pesticides at the air-water interface under the influences of river input and atmospheric transport. The air-sea gas exchange of DDT was characterized by net volatilization with a marked difference in its fluxes between summer (140 ng/m2/d) and the other three seasons (12 ng/m2/d), possibly due to the high surface seawater temperatures and larger riverine input in summer. However, there was no obvious seasonal variation in the atmospheric HCH deposition, and the air-sea gas exchange reached equilibrium because of low HCH levels in the air and seawater after the long-term banning of HCH and the degradation. The gas exchange flux of HCH was comparable to the dry and wet deposition fluxes at the air-water interface. This suggests that the influences from the Yangtze River input and East Asian continental outflow on the fate of HCH in the YRE were limited. The gas exchange flux of DDT was about fivefold higher than the total dry and wet deposition fluxes. DDT residues in agricultural soil transported by enhanced riverine runoff were responsible for sustaining such a high net volatilization in summer. Moreover, our results indicated that there were fresh sources of DDT from the local environment to sustain net volatilization throughout the year.},

  abstract = {Gaseous exchange fluxes of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) across the air-water interface of the coastal East China Sea were determined in order to assess whether the contaminated plume of the Yangtze River could be an important regional source of OCPs to the atmosphere. Hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), chlordane compounds (CHLs), and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) were the most frequently detected OCPs in air and water. Air-water exchange was mainly characterized by net volatilization for all measured OCPs. The net gaseous exchange flux ranged 10-240 ng/ (m2{$\cdot$}day) for {$\gamma$}-HCH, 60-370 ng/(m2{$\cdot$}day) for trans-CHL, 97-410 ng/(m2{$\cdot$}day) for cis-CHL, and {$\sim$}0 (e.g., equilibrium) to 490 ng/(m2{$\cdot$} day) for p,p{${'}$}-DDE. We found that the plume of the large contaminated river can serve as a significant regional secondary atmospheric source of legacy contaminants released in the catchment. In particular, the sediment plume represented the relevant source of DDT compounds (especially p,p{${'}$}-DDE) sustaining net degassing when clean air masses from the open ocean reached the plume area. In contrast, a mass balance showed that, for HCHs, contaminated river discharge (water and sediment) plumes were capable of sustaining volatilization throughout the year. These results demonstrate the inconsistencies in the fate of HCHs and DDTs in this large estuarine system with declining primary sources.},

In air, {$\gamma$}-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), transchlordane (TC) and cis-chlordane (CC) had significantly (p b 0.001) higher concentrations than {$\alpha$}-HCH, o,p{${'}$}-Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p{${'}$}-DDE, p,p{${'}$}-DDT and {$\alpha$}-endosulfan. Generally, {$\alpha$}-HCH concentrations in the atmosphere were quite uniform over the Chinese marginal seas. However, the highest concentrations of {$\gamma$}-HCH, TC, CC and DDT compounds were found in the southern parts of the marginal seas, and higher concentrations of {$\alpha$}-endosulfan were observed in the northern part of the marginal seas. In water, the OCP concentrations varied over a narrow range, with hundreds picogram per liter levels. Air{\textendash}water exchange gradients suggested net deposition or equilibrium for {$\gamma$}-HCH and o,p{${'}$}-DDT and net volatilization for {$\alpha$}-HCH, CC, TC, p,p{${'}$}-DDE and p,p{${'}$}-DDT. Due to the potential source of those compounds from coastal water runoff, the ocean water played an important role of OCP sources for the atmosphere after a long period of OCP prohibition.},

Relationships between the air concentrations of these OCPs and their global emissions are also discussed. Differences between the pathways of a- and h-HCH to the Arctic Ocean are described in the context of environmental concentrating and diluting processes. These concentrating and diluting processes are shown to control the temporal and spatial loading of northern oceans and that the HCH burdens in marine biota from these oceans respond accordingly. The HCHs provide an elegant example of how hemispheric-scale solvent switching processes can alter the ocean into which an HCH congener partitions, how air{\textendash}water partitioning controls the pathway for HCHs entering the Arctic, and how the various pathways impact spatial and temporal trends of HCH residues in arctic animals feeding out of marine and terrestrial foodwebs.},

  abstract = {Seventeen halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) were concurrently analyzed in surface seawater and low atmospheric samples from the Bohai Sea during four research cruises. HFRs mainly existed in particulate phases, and in general decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) was the predominant compound in both air and water samples. Relatively high concentrations were observed in the water of Laizhou Bay (LB), where the largest manufacturing base of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in China is located and weak water exchange occurs. Transport from LB by coastal currents may be the main source of BFRs in some areas without emission sources. The HFRs in seawater exhibited distinct seasonal variation, with significantly higher concentrations in winter than those in summer. The controlling factors include the resuspension of sediment induced by large wind waves in winter and phytoplankton scavenging in spring and seawater stratification in summer. HFRs composition varied largely in different seasons, due to the different extents of riverine input and atmospheric deposition. Normally, for air masses passing through the nearby industrial regions, high concentrations of DBDPE (up to 1780 pg m{\`A}3) co-existed with high total suspended particle (TSP) levels (up to 150 mg m{\`A}3). The estimated atmospheric deposition fluxes of HFRs were 19, 51, and 80 kg season{\`A}1 in spring, summer, and winter, respectively, indicating that the Bohai Sea is a sink of HFRs via atmospheric deposition. This study has increased our understanding of the behaviors and fates of the legacy and novel HFRs in the shallow coastal sea.},

China is one of the largest producers and users of pesticides in the world. However, very limited data are available about the environmental fates of CUPs. Four CUPs (trifluralin, chlorothalonil, chlorpyrifos, and dicofol) in surface seawater and low atmospheric samples taken during research cruises on the Bohai Sea in August and December 2016 and February 2017 were analyzed, we added the spring data sampled in May 2012 to the discussion of seasonal variation. In our study, chlorpyrifos was the most abundant CUPs in the gas phase with a mean abundance of 59.06 {$\pm$} 126.94 pg m-3, and dicofol had the highest concentration dissolved in seawater (mean: 115.94 {$\pm$} 123.16 pg L-1). The concentrations of all target compounds were higher during May and August due to intensive use and relatively high temperatures in the spring and summer. Backward trajectories indicated that air masses passing through the eastern coast of the Bohai Sea contained high concentrations of pollutants, while the air masses from the Bohai and Yellow Seas were less polluted. The high concentration of pollutants in seawater was not only influenced by high yields from the source region of production or usage, but also by input from polluted rivers. Volatilization from surface water was found to be an important source of trifluralin and chlorpyrifos in the air. Air-sea gas exchange of chlorothalonil underwent strong net deposition (mean FRs: 51.67), which was driven by higher concentrations in air and indicates that the Bohai Sea acted as a sink for chlorothalonil.},

Since fronts are associated with convergent currents and productive fishing grounds, any possible convergence of pollutants at fronts would raise concerns. The focus here is on relatively persistent organic pollutants, POPs, as non-persistent organic pollutants are rarely found in the open ocean. Results from recent cruises in the Atlantic Ocean are examined for POP distributions across ocean fronts in (i) the Canary Current; (ii) the Gulf Stream; and (iii) the Amazon and Rio de la Plata Plumes. Few studies achieved a spatial resolution of 10{\textendash}20 km, while most had 100{\textendash}300 km between adjacent stations. The majority of the wellresolved studies measured perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), which seem particularly well suited for frontal resolution. In the NE Atlantic, concentrations of PFCs sharply decreased between SW Europe and NW Africa upon crossing the Canary Current Front at 24{\textendash}27{\textdegree}N. In the Western Atlantic, the PFC concentrations sharply increased upon entering the Amazon River Plume and Rio de la Plata Plume. In the NW Atlantic, concentrations of several pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are very high in Rhode Island Sound, decreasing to below detection limit in the open ocean. The more persistent and already phased-out polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) displayed elevated concentrations in the Gulf Stream and Rhode Island Sound, thereby highlighting the importance of ocean fronts, along-front currents, and cross-frontal transport for the dispersal of PCBs.},

The use of passive samplers also enabled the detection of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its transformation products across the tropical Atlantic, indicating net deposition. There were clear differences between the southern and northern hemisphere apparent in terms of atmospheric concentrations: Once the ship moved from the southern into the northern hemisphere air, concentrations of HCB and other organochlorine pesticides increased several-fold. For large swaths of the tropical Atlantic Ocean, neither PCB nor organochlorine pesticide dissolved concentrations varied much longitudinally, probably due to efficient mixing by ocean currents. In selected samples, dissolved concentrations reflected the influence of river plumes and major ocean currents far away from the continents. Dissolved concentrations of PCBs 28, 52, 101, 118, and HCB increased in the Amazon plume and the Gulf Stream. While the Amazon plume flushed only a few kg of PCBs and HCB, the Gulf Stream is potentially delivering tons of PCBs into the North Atlantic annually.},

  abstract = {The Arctic Ocean is known to be contaminated by various persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The Fram Strait, the only deepwater passage to the Arctic Ocean (from the Atlantic Ocean), represents an unquantified gateway for POPs fluxes into and out of the Arctic. Polyethylene passive samplers were deployed in vertical profiles in the Fram Strait and in air and surface water in the Canadian Archipelago to determine the concentrations, profiles, and mass fluxes of dissolved polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides. In the Fram Strait, higher concentrations of {$\Sigma$}PCBs (1.3{\textendash}3.6 pg/L) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes ({$\Sigma$}DDTs, 5.2{\textendash}9.1 pg/L) were observed in the deepwater masses (below 1,000 m), similar to nutrient-like vertical profiles. There was net southward transport of hexachlorobenzene and hexachlorocyclohexanes ({$\Sigma$}HCHs) of 0.70 and 14 Mg/year but a net northward transport of {$\Sigma$}PCBs at 0.16 Mg/year through the Fram Strait. Plain Language Summary Persistent organic pollutants can reach the Arctic Ocean by long-range atmospheric transport, ocean currents, and inputs from the large Arctic rivers. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides, which have been extensively used since the 1930s, were banned and listed in the United Nations Environment Programme Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants in 2001. We performed the first pan-Arctic deployments of passive samplers to gain knowledge of the occurrence, transport, and fate of these legacy contaminants in the remote Arctic. Our results demonstrated the ubiquitous presence of persistent industrial and agricultural contaminants across the Canadian Arctic and throughout the water column of the Fram Strait. While atmospheric transport seems mostly responsible for the presence of these pollutants in the surface Arctic Ocean, in the Fram Strait, concentrations of PCBs and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) increased in deep waters, indicating their penetration to the deep ocean environment. Our results also showed the legacy hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) are released from the Arctic Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean via the deepwater Fram Strait, while PCBs are still loaded from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arctic Ocean.},

The concentrations of OCPs ranged from 0.80 to 7.90 ng/g dry weight, with dichlorodiphenytrichloroethanes (DDTs) as the main components. Levels of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and DDTs in sediment from Prydz Bay were comparable to the majority of marine sediment worldwide. The distributions of OCPs were characterized by a distinct ``quasiconcentric circle'' pattern, which has significantly positive relationship with total organic carbon (TOC) of sediment and controlled by the local hydrodynamic conditions and sources of organic matter. Source apportionment demonstrated that HCHs and chlordanes in Prydz Bay were mainly derived from the long range atmospheric transport (LRAT) of these compounds from off regions. However, current inputs of DDT-based compounds and lindane are suggested to exist either as a result of the LART from the neighbouring countries or re-emission from melting glacier. The annual sedimentary fluxes of OCPs were 0.007 to 7.12 pg/cm2/yr, about one to three orders of magnitude lower than some data from the Arctic areas. Based on a rough calculation of r-HCH, only 0.3{\textendash}1.5\% of the air-seawater net deposition would be buried in sediment, implying a long active lifetime of OCPs in Antarctica. We preliminarily indicate an increase of OCP contamination in Antarctic environment afterwards when considering the possible occurrence of ``fresh'' sources and low proportion of sedimentary sink.},

  abstract = {The development of coastal regions has contributed to the intensification of environmental contamination, which can accumulate in aquatic biota, such as shrimps.

Amongst others, these include organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs), brominated flame retardants (BFRs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and synthetic musks (SMs). These pollutants, classified as endocrine disruptors, are related to adverse effects in humans and since one of the major routes of exposition is ingestion, this is a cause for concern regarding their presence in food. The aim of the present study was to quantify the presence of environmental pollutants in shrimp samples and in the water from their habitat along the northwest Portuguese coast. In seawater samples, only two OCPs (lindane and DDD) and one BFR (BTBPE) were detected, and in shrimp samples, one OCP (DDD) and three SMs (HHCB, AHTN and ketone) were found. Bioaccumulation and the risk assessment of dietary exposure of SMs in shrimp samples were investigated. It was observed that all shrimp samples analyzed significantly presented bioaccumulation of the three SMs found. Concentrations of SMs detected in shrimp samples do not present a health risk for the adult Portuguese population.},

  abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were measured in dry deposition and sediment trap samples from the eastern Mediterranean and the results of the present and previous studies were synthesized in order to construct a mass balance budget describing the status and dynamics of PCBs in this region. According to our calculations, the burden of total PCBs in the euphotic zone of the eastern Mediterranean should approach 84,000 kg, while the corresponding pool in the overlying atmosphere should be about 162 kg. The atmospheric input of PCBs in the respective water basin through dry and wet deposition should be 300 and 1300 kg yr               -1               , respectively. On the contrary, air-sea exchange should cause a net volatilization of PCBs from seawater to the atmosphere by 3150 kg yr               -1               . Moreover, PCBs are removed from the water column with a settling flux of 350 kg yr               -1               and under steady state conditions, an additional input of these pollutants should be required to counterbalance the outflows from the water basin. The discharge of urban and industrial sewage, riverine input and transport of more polluted surface waters from western to eastern Mediterranean may account for most of this inflow. In the atmospheric compartment, the removal flux of PCBs due to their destruction by hydroxyl radicals (6650 kg yr               -1               ) was approximately 4 times higher than their deposition flux (wet plus dry). On the basis of these data, 5100 kg of PCBs should enter into the atmosphere of eastern Mediterranean annually in order to achieve steady state conditions. This influx may result from long or short range transport of atmospheric PCBs emitted from contaminated terrestrial surfaces.},

  abstract = {Air samples were collected between April 1999 and March 2001 at a background marine site in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The average concentrations of total PCB congeners ({$\Sigma$}PCBs) in the gas and particulate phases of the atmosphere were 68.1 {$\pm$} 28.8 and 2.3 {$\pm$} 1.8 pg/m               3               , respectively. The lack of seasonal variation for the atmospheric concentration of individual congeners and {$\Sigma$}PCBs and the shallow slopes obtained from the Clausius{\textendash}Clapeyron (CC) plots for several PCB congeners indicated that long-range transport is the main factor controlling the atmospheric levels of PCBs in this area. Most of the episodes with elevated concentrations of {$\Sigma$}PCBs concurred with air transport from western and central Europe. This observation was mostly attributed to the predominance of N-NW winds in eastern Mediterranean. The wind speed apparently did not affect the atmospheric concentration of PCBs. Significant changes observed on the homologue group profile of PCBs were mostly related to the origin of air parcels sampled and during summer were most probably related to the reaction of the lighter congeners with OH radicals. Partitioning of PCBs between gas and particulate phases was well correlated with the subcooled liquid vapor pressure (               P                                L                                               o                              ) for 11 of the 37 samples.

  abstract = {Water bodies are important storage media for persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and this function is increased in coastal regions because their inputs are higher than those to the open sea. The air{\textendash}water interface is extensively involved with the global cycling of PCBs because it is the place where they accumulate due to depositional processes and where they may be emitted by gaseous exchange. In this work the parallel collection of air, microlayer and sub-superficial water samples was performed in July 2005 at a site in the Venice lagoon to evaluate the summer gaseous flux of PCBs. The total concentration of PCBs (sum of 118 congeners) in air varies from 87 to 273 pg m{\`A}3, whereas in the operationally defined dissolved phase of microlayer and sub-superficial water samples it varies from 159 to 391 pg L{\`A}1. No significant enrichment of dissolved PCB into the microlayer has been observed, although a preferential accumulation of most hydrophobic congeners occurs. Due to this behaviour, we believe that the modified two-layer model was the most suitable approach for the evaluation of the flux at the air{\textendash}sea interface, because it takes into account the influence of the microlayer. From its application it appears that PCB volatilize from the lagoon waters with a net flux varying from 58 to 195 ng m{\`A}2 d{\`A}1 (uncertainty: {$\pm$}50{\textendash}64\%) due to the strong influence of wind speed. This flux is greater than those reported in the literature for the atmospheric deposition and rivers input and reveals that PCB are actively emitted from the Venice lagoon in summer months.},

Contaminant discharges of PCBs and OCPs into the sea were calculated in about 1,247 g day-1 (948 g day-1 of PCBs and 326 g day-1 of OCPs), showing that this river should account as one of the main contribution sources of PCBs and OCPs to the Tyrrhenian Sea.},

Atmospheric PCBs and OCPs were mainly in gas-phase in both periods. However, their dissolved and particle-phase water concentrations were comparable. For PCBs, 3 and 4-Cl congeners were dominant while chlorpyrifos, endosulfans and HCHs were the most abundant OCPs for all samples. Especially in summer, calculated net gas-exchange PCB fluxes were mainly volatilization from the water ranging from - 0.2 (volatilization, PCB-101) to -30.0 (volatilization, PCB-31) ng m-2 day- 1. For OCPs, net flux ranged from -0.03 (volatilization, cis-nonachlor) to 1568 (deposition, endosulfan I) ng m- 2 day- 1 and they have seasonal variations with generally deposition in winter and volatilization in summer. However, endosulfan I, II, endosulfan sulfate, {$\alpha$}- and {$\gamma$}HCH deposited in both periods. The calculated residence times of PCBs and OCPs in the water column indicated that the gasexchange in the Bay is at least as or a more important mechanism than advection. Annual gaseous absorption and volatilization fluxes were calculated and were used along with the estimated dry deposition fluxes and wet deposition fluxes measured recently at a suburban site in Izmir to determine the relative contributions of different atmospheric mechanisms to the pollutant inventory of the Bay water column. Results suggested that the relative contributions of all studied mechanisms to the water column PCB and OCP inventories were significant.},

The determined KOA values were within a factor of 0.5 (endosulfan sulfate) to 7.9 (endrin aldehyde) for values calculated as the ratio of octanolewater partition coefficient to dimensionless Henry's law constant. The internal energies of phase transfer between octanol and air (DUOA) ranged between 71.8 and 95.4 kJ mol{\`A}1 and they were within the reported range for OCPs (55.8e105 kJ mol{\`A}1). Atmospheric and soil OCP concentrations were also measured in Izmir, Turkey, and data used to investigate the soileair gas exchange. Net soileair gas exchange fluxes of OCPs ranged from {\`A}0.01 (volatilization, cis-nonachlor) to 56.4 ng m{\`A}2 day{\`A}1 (deposition, chlorpyrifos) in winter, while in summer they ranged from {\`A}0.03 (trans-nonachlor) to 329 ng m{\`A}2 day{\`A}1 (endosulfan I). In both sampling periods, endosulfan I and II, trans-nonachlor, p,p0-DDD and p,p0-DDT were generally deposited to the soil while g-HCH and heptachlor epoxide mostly volatilized. Fluxes of other OCPs were variable (volatilization or absorption) due to their largely fluctuating ambient air concentrations. Calculated dry deposition and recently measured wet deposition fluxes were used to estimate the relative importance of different mechanisms (i.e., dry deposition, wet deposition, gas absorption, and volatilization) to the local soil pollutant inventory. Generally, all mechanisms contributed significantly to the soil OCP inventory. Volatilization fluxes were generally much lower than the sum of input fluxes (dry deposition, wet deposition and gas absorption) for most of the OCPs indicating a net deposition to the soil.},

Air-sea exchange occurs through gas exchange (deposition and volatilization), wet deposition and dry deposition. Atmospheric concentrations are interpolated into the model domain from results of the EMEP MSC-East multi-compartmental model (Gusev et al, 2009). The North Sea is net depositional for {$\gamma$}-HCH, and is dominated by gas deposition with notable seasonal variability and a downward trend over the 10 year period. Volatilization rates of {$\gamma$}-HCH are generally a factor of 2{\textendash}3 less than gas deposition in winter, spring and summer but greater in autumn when the North Sea is net volatilizational. A downward trend in fugacity ratios is found, since gas deposition is decreasing faster than volatilization. The North Sea is net volatilizational for PCB 153, with highest rates of volatilization to deposition found in the areas surrounding polluted British and continental river sources. Large quantities of PCB 153 entering through rivers lead to very high local rates of volatilization.},

We chose to simulate the fate of two POPs with very different properties, {$\gamma$}-HCH and PCB 153. Since the fate and cycling of POPs are strongly affected by hydrodynamic processes, a high resolution version of the Hamburg Shelf Ocean Model (HAMSOM) was developed and utilised.

Air and wet deposition samples were collected from 2 February 1995 and continued through 6 August 1996. Vapor total PCB (tPCB) concentrations in air ranged from 0.21 to 4.78 ng m{\textbackslash} with a dominance of tri-chlorinated PCBs. Dissolved tPCBs in rain ranged from 0.08 to 3.34 ng l{\textbackslash}, with tetra-chlorinated PCBs predominating. The predominant isomers found in air and rain were - and -HCH, - and -chlordanes, 4,4-DDT, and dieldrin. The concentrations of PCBs and pesticides in the air and rain revealed no clear seasonal trend. Elevated levels of PCBs in the air occurred when temperatures were high and wind came from urban and industrialized areas (S, SW, NW, and W of the site). Concentrations of HCHs were elevated in April, May, and October, perhaps due to local and/or regional applications of -HCH (lindane). Other pesticides showed no notable temporal variation. When winds originated from the Gulf of Mexico (southeasterly), lower concentrations of organochlorines were detected in the air. The direct deposition rate (wet\#dry) of PCBs to Galveston Bay (6.40 g m{\textbackslash} yr{\textbackslash}) was signi"cantly higher than that of pesticides by a factor of 5\vphantom\{\}10. The net \#ux from gas exchange estimated for PCBs was from Galveston Bay water to the atmosphere (78 g m{\textbackslash} yr{\textbackslash}).

Air samples were collected using a high-volume air sampler (filter and polyurethane foam) on board the Argentinean research cruise R/V Puerto Deseado (CONICET). Samples were analyzed for 50 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), 22 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and 14 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). These POPs classes showed a trend of decreasing levels from near-shore to open ocean sites. OCPs and PCBs were in the same order of magnitude (2.71{\textendash}87.1 pg/m3 and 9.56{\textendash}130 pg/m3, respectively) while PBDEs levels were significantly lower (0.69{\textendash}2.58 pg/m3). Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), endosulfans, chlordanes, hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and heptachlors were between 0.20 and 17.8 pg/m3, while drines and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were at lower levels (0.28{\textendash}3.71 pg/m3). The most frequently detected PCBs were congeners 32, 28, 44, 52, 95, representing N 50\% of the total. The PBDEs congener pattern was dominated by congener 209 (70\%), followed by 47 and 99 (16\% and 7\%, respectively). Air parcel back trajectories for the study period provided few insights as trajectories mainly stemmed from the open ocean with limited inputs from continental sources. These results indicate that the concentration of POPs (namely PCBs, OCPs, and PBDEs) in air remain elevated in the near-shore environment and then drop-off substantially beyond a distance of about 400 km. This has implications for the loading of POPs and delivery to the marine environment in the near coastal zone.},

Polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) was used for the extraction of the selected analytes and two procedures have been optimised and validated, one for seawater samples (100 mL) and another for interstitial water samples (10 mL), using PDMS stir bars of 20 mm and 10 mm size, respectively. The extraction and analytical conditions, such as extraction time, matrix effects, sample volume and desorption time, were optimised. The proposed methods are sensitive, simple and show good linearity and detection limits lower than 1 ng L-1 with seawater and lower than 10 ng L-1 with interstitial marine water for the majority of compounds tested. Repeatability and reproducibility, expressed as relative standard deviation, have values lower than 20\% for the majority of analytes considered. The recoveries for both sample volume procedures are higher than 60 and 70\% for 10 and 100 mL, respectively, except for the more apolar (some PAHs and PCBs) and the more polar (some triazines) analytes which present lower values. The present SBSE/GC/MS method was applied for the analysis of trace organic contaminants in seawater and interstitial water samples from Cadiz Bay (SW of Spain). Terbutylazine, DDX and some PAHs were found at several seawater sampling points at ng L-1 levels, and some PAHs in interstitial water too.},

High concentrations of HCHs, DDTs and endosulfan found in surface waters from rivers suggest that rivers are the major source of dissolved OCPs to coastal marine ecosystems. We interpret variations in the distribution and concentration as an apparent oscillation between rain and snow-scavenging processes that might determine the type of OCPs that can be preferentially deposited on mountains, glaciers, rivers, estuaries, and finally transferred to the marine realm. Predominance of {$\alpha$}-HCH, {$\gamma$}HCH, p,p{${'}$}-DDE and {$\alpha$}-endosulfan compounds suggest that the main deposition mechanism of OCPs to the Chilean Patagonia is rain scavenging. Snow and rain can be additional sources of OCPs that must be considered for future studies in fjord systems in Chilean Patagonia.},

Particular attention is given to the environmental fate of these pollutants, which modifies their impact on the organisms living in the Antarctic. OCPs have been delivered to the Antarctic environment mainly via long-range transport from inhabited areas, and due to their long accumulation they are sometimes reemitted from melting cryosphere. Since climate change is forecasted to intensify, the release of anthropogenic pollutants from increased seasonal thaw may prove its importance for the future state of this unspoiled environment. However, the limited estimations of the OCPs storage magnitude in the Antarctic cryosphere are relatively crude and may err significantly towards higher values. The OCPs are already present in different types of animal tissues at every trophic level, where they may cause negative effects such as reproductive disorders, decreased survival rates, and an increased parasitic load. Therefore, it is important to continuously monitor OCP concentrations in various elements of the Antarctic environment and the fate of these pollutants, taking into account their global and local sources, including the remobilization from frozen state.},

  abstract = {In the present study, we examine contamination with PCBs, HCB and PAHs in the seawater of Arctic fjords (Hornsund, Kongsfjorden and Adventfjorden) which differ in environmental conditions and are particularly sensitive to climate change. We also investigate how the melting glaciers and oc{$\sum$}ean currents may {$\sum$}affect the distribution and fate of target compounds in the seawater column in the fjords. The 7 PCB, HCB and 12 PAH concentrations in seawater ranged from, respectively: 0.002 to 41.2 ng/L; from LOQ to 233 ng/L; and from 0.196 to 311 ng/L. The research indicates that the concentrations of contaminants detected in Arctic fjords depend on the physicochemical properties of these compounds, local human activity and occurrence of glacier meltwaters. Detected HCB and PAH concentrations in most of the seawater samples were at levels classified as harmless, however in 30 out of 80 analysed suspended particulate matter samples some compounds were present at toxic levels.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate abundance and expression activity of the catabolic genes targeting widespread pollutants, such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), poly\- chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and hexachloro-cyclohexane (HCH) in the Black Sea water column and sediments. Concentrations of PAHs, PCBs and HCH were determined by gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spec\- trometry (MS) and electron capture (ECD) detectors. bphA1, PAH-RHD{$\alpha$}, nahAc, linA and linB that encode biphenyl 2,3 dioxygenase, {$\alpha$}-subunits of ring hydroxylating dioxygenases, naphthalene dioxygenase, dehydro\- chlorinase and halidohydrolase correspondently were quantified by quantitative PCR. More recalcitrant PAHs, PCBs and HCH tended to accumulate in the Black Sea environments. In water samples, 3- and 4-ringed PAHs outnumbered naphthalene, while PAHs with {$>$} 4 rings prevailed in the sediments. Congeners with 4{\textendash}8 chlorines with ortho-position of the substituents were the most abundant among the PCBs. {$\beta$}-HCH was determined at highest concentration in water samples, and total amount of HCH exceeded its legacy Environmental Quality Standard value. bphA1, was the most numerous gene in water layers (105 copies/mL) and sediments (105 copies/ mg), followed by linB and PAH-RHD{$\alpha$} genes (103 copies/mL; 105 copies/mg). The least abundant genes were linA (103 copies/mL; 104 copies/mg) and nahAc (102 copies/mL; 104 copies/mg). The most widely distributed gene bph{\cyrchar\CYRA}1 was one of the least expressed (10- 3-10- 2 copies/mL; 10- 1 copies/mg). The most actively expressed genes were linB (101-102 copies/mL; 103 copies/mg), PAH-RHD{$\alpha$} (101 copies/mL; 102 copies/mg) and linA (10- 1-100 copies/mL; 100 copies/mg). Interaction of bacteria with PAHs, PCBs and HCH is evidenced by high copy numbers of the catabolic genes that initiate their degradation. More persistent compounds, such as high-molecular weight PAHs or {$\beta$}-HCH are accumulating in the Black Sea water and sediments, albeit microbial activity is directed against them.},

SPMDs were shown to be effective in concentrating trace organocldorine contaminants from both air and water. Estimates of ambient air and water concentrations for selected organochlorines (OCs) were made from their concentrations in SPMDs. Comparison of the ratio of the estimated air to water OC concentrations to the non-dimensionalHenry's Law constants suggests that the net flux of OCs should be from the ambient air to the water. In this study, SPMD values for coastal air concentrations were compared to those recently obtained by Iwata, Tanabe, et al., for measurements of OC air concentrations over the North Pacific oce{\textasciitilde}a. SPMD derived estimates for coastal air concentrations of c{\textasciitilde}and T-HCCH were roughly 9 times higher than open ocean values; the cis- and trans-chlordanes were 70 times higher; and the p,p'-DDE levels are more than a thousand times higher. Coastal air concentration estimates for hexachlorobenzene were comparable to tho{\textasciitilde}u{\textasciitilde}previously reported for the open ocean. Comparison of OC ratios for open ocean air to those estimated for coasl{\textasciitilde} air suggests the difference in the composition of coastal air is primarilydue to an increase in THCCH and a large increase in p,p'-DDE concentrations.},

Four current use pesticides (dacthal, chlorpyrifos, trifluralin, and pentachloronitrobenzene) and one legacy organochlorine pesticide ({$\alpha$}-hexachlorocyclohexane) were detected in ponds in Resolute Passage, Canadian Arctic, in 2012. Melt-pond concentrations changed over time as a function of gas exchange, precipitation, and dilution with melting sea ice. Observed increases in melt-pond concentrations for all detected pesticides were associated with precipitation events. Dacthal reached the highest concentration of all current use pesticides in ponds (95 {$\pm$} 71 pg L-1), a value exceeding measured concentrations in the under-ice (0 m) and 5 m seawater by N 10 and N16 times, respectively. Drainage of dacthal-enriched pond water to the ocean during ice break-up provides an important ice-mediated annual delivery route, adding {\textasciitilde}30\% of inventory in the summer Mixed Layer (ML; 10 m) in the Resolute Passage, and a concentrating mechanism with potential implications for exposures to organisms such as ice algae, and phytoplankton.},

  abstract = {For decades sea ice has been perceived as a physical barrier for the loading of contaminants to the Arctic Ocean. We show that sea ice, in fact, facilitates the delivery of organic contaminants to the Arctic marine food web through processes that: 1) are independent of contaminant physical{\textendash}chemical properties (e.g. 2{\textendash}3-fold increase in exposure to brine-associated biota), and 2) depend on physical{\textendash}chemical properties and, therefore, differentiate between contaminants (e.g. atmospheric loading of contaminants to melt ponds over the summer, and their subsequent leakage to the ocean). We estimate the concentrations of legacy organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and current-use pesticides (CUPs) in melt pond water in the Beaufort Sea, Canadian High Arctic, in 2008, at near-gas exchange equilibrium based on Henry's law constants (HLCs), air concentrations and exchange dynamics. CUPs currently present the highest risk of increased exposures through melt pond loading and drainage due to the high ratio of melt pond water to seawater concentration (Melt pond Enrichment Factor, MEF), which ranges from 2 for dacthal to 10 for endosulfan I. Melt pond contaminant enrichment can be perceived as a hypothetical `pump' delivering contaminants from the atmosphere to the ocean under ice-covered conditions, with 2{\textendash}10\% of CUPs annually entering the Beaufort Sea via this input route compared to the standing stock in the Polar Mixed Layer of the ocean. The abovementioned processes are strongly favored in first-year ice compared to multi-year ice and, therefore, the dynamic balance between contaminant inventories and contaminant deposition to the surface ocean is being widely affected by the large-scale icescape transition taking place in the Arctic.},

  abstract = {Like most zooplankton, Calanus hyperboreus undergoes seasonal migration spending late spring and summer grazing at the surface and the rest of the year in diapause at depth. As a result, in the Arctic Ocean this copepod resides for part of the year in the hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) enriched surface water and for part of the year at depth where HCH undergoes significant microbial degradation resulting in far lower concentrations ({$\sim$}3 times for {$\alpha$}-HCH). We collected C. hyperboreus from summer and winter from the Amundsen Gulf and measured their {$\alpha$}-HCH concentrations, enantiomeric compositions, and bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) to investigate how this copepod responds to the change in exposure to {$\alpha$}-HCH. C. hyperboreus collected in winter were also cultured for 5 weeks under surface water conditions without feeding to investigate bioconcentration dynamics following spring ascent. Concentration of {$\alpha$}-HCH was 2-3 times higher in individuals from the summer than those from the winter. Log BAF from the summer (feeding period) does not exceed log BCF (bioconcentration factor) from the culturing experiment (no feeding) suggesting that {$\alpha$}-HCH concentration in C. hyperboreus is maintained through equilibration rather than feeding. After the spring ascent from deep waters, C. hyperboreus approach equilibrium partitioning with the higher surface water concentrations of {$\alpha$}-HCH within 3-4 weeks with about 60\% of bioconcentration taking place in the first week. The C. hyperboreus {$\alpha$}-HCH chiral signature also reflects ambient seawater and can therefore be used as a determinant of residence depth. Even though a single cycle of seasonal migration does not result in a significant redistribution of {$\alpha$}-HCH in the water column, this process could have a significant cumulative effect over longer time scales with particular local importance where the zooplankton biomass is high and the ocean depth is great enough to provide substantial vertical concentration gradients.},

The mean concentrations of total DDTs, HCHs, OCPs and PCBs in sediments were 2.84, 0.06, 3.84 and 0.17 ng g{\`A}1 dw, while those in tissues were 1.85, 0.22, 9.43 and 1.61 ng g{\`A}1 dw, respectively. The elevated OCPs and PCBs levels in mangrove leaves may be caused by atmospheric sedimentation. The biota sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) values of both OCPs (mean: 3.4) and PCBs (mean: 9.9) are generally larger than one, implying mangroves' bioaccumulation and their ability to intercept pollutants. The BSAFs of PCBs in mangrove tissues were negatively correlated with the PCB congener's octanol-water partition coefficients (KOW, R {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.58, n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 31, p {$<$} 0.001), suggesting that lower chlorinated CB congeners are more bioaccumulative in mangroves. In order to better understanding the fate of these organochlorine compounds, the cycling (including the standing accumulation, the annual absorption, the annual net retention, the annual return, and the turnover period) of OCPs and PCBs in the Mangrove Reserves were estimated, and the results indicated that mangroves are playing important roles in retaining OCPs and PCBs.},

Sediment core dating was accomplished using the 210Pb method. The average concentrations of DDTs, HCHs and chlordanes in water were 1.96, 0.71, 0.81 ng l{\`A}1, while in SPM were 36.5, 2.5, 35.7 ng g{\`A}1 dry weight, in surface sediment were 20.2, 0.50, 2.4 ng g{\`A}1 dry weight, and in fish were 125.4, 0.43, 13.1 ng g{\`A}1 wet weight, respectively. DDTs concentrations in various matrices of Deep Bay were intermediate compared with those in other areas. Temporal trends of the targeted OCPs levels in sediment core generally increased from 1948 to 2004, with the highest levels in top or sub-surface sediment. Both DDT composition and historical trends indicated an ongoing fresh DDT input. A positive relationship between the bioconcentration factor (BCF) of target chemicals and the corresponding octanol{\textendash}water partition coefficient (Kow), and between the biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAF) and the Kow were observed in the Bay. The risk assessment indicated that there were potential ecological and human health risks for the target OCPs in Deep Bay.},

Although the inventory and use of PCBs are extensively reported worldwide, the status of PCBs in Iran is still unknown. In this study, the concentrations of PCBs were determined in the environmental matrices and in five commercially important fish species from Larak coral Island, Persian Gulf, Iran, in winter and summer 2015. A positive correlation was found among PCBs levels and congeners profiles in seawater (0.97e3.10 ng L{\`A}1), surface sediments (2.95e7.95 ng g{\`A}1dw) and fish samples (7.20e90.19 ng g{\`A}1dw), indicating fish as suitable bioindicator of environmental PCBs contamination. In all matrices, a high contribution of light and medium chlorinated congeners was detected in both seasons. In fish, the higher PCBs levels were found for both sexes in both seasons in liver and kidney than other tissues (skin, gonad, muscle) due to their high lipid content and PCBs lipophilicity. More importantly, the risks for human health associated with fish consumption were also evaluated, and it was found that all the toxicity indices measured for PCBs were within the World Health Organization (WHO) permissible limit of food consumption. However, it is highly recommended to inform the local population about potential risks attributable to dietary incorporation of locally caught fish, and establish a surveillance monitoring programme on PCBs in this region.},

Based on the above-mentioned assumptions, in this work we studied the presence of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 14 dioxin and non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the neritic protected marine area of the Southern Ligurian Sea, affected by the impact of human activities. The study was focused on the possible partition of micropollutants within seawater, sediment and zooplankton. Results showed that both seasonal and anthropic causes strongly affect contaminant transfer behaviors, with summertime periods more impacted by PAH and PCB contamination. Regarding the PAH contamination, low molecular weight congeners were mainly detected in the target matrices, revealing concentrations up to 1 {\textmu}g/L in seawater (anthracene), 250 {\textmu}g/Kg in sediments (benzo[b]fluoranthene) and 2.3 mg/Kg in carnivorous copepods. Concerning PCBs, only few congeners were detected in the matrices studied. To better understand the occurrence of preferential bioaccumulation pathways in zooplankton, partition studies were also performed in several taxa (hyperbenthic Isopoda, holoplanktonic crustacean copepods and ichthyoplankton) through the calculation of BAF values, observing that both living and feeding habits could influence the bioaccumulation process.},

  abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as PCBs, but also substances still on the market such as PBDEs are transported over long distances and are present in many environmental media. In principle, differences in the physicochemical properties and environmental half-lives of different POPs would lead to a ``fractionation'' process, i.e., more volatile substances would be transported more rapidly and over larger distances than less volatile compounds. However, the fractionation pattern to be expected on the basis of chemical properties is often confounded by spatial and temporal variability of the emissions of the chemicals and by the conditions under which samples are taken in the field. Here, modeling results are presented that support the identification of fractionation patterns, and key questions in the area of global fractionation requiring further investigation are identified. Research needs concern the degradation processes of POPs in the gas phase, the interaction of POPs with atmospheric aerosols (aerosol{\textendash}air partitioning; reactivity of the aerosol-bound fraction; deposition and transport with aerosols), and the characterization of various surface media (soil, vegetation, ice/snow, and water) with respect to their sorptive capacity for POPs (importance of secondary sources).},

Concentrations in suspension exceeded those in solution in most samples, as a result of the relatively high suspended matter concentrations in the waters around Iceland.

Concentrations of 17 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were measured in size-fractionated zooplankton, in phytoplankton (Ͼ0.7 ␮m), and in the dissolved water phase (Ͻ0.7 ␮m) in the surface water of the northern Barents Sea marginal ice zone east and north of Spitsbergen (Norway) and in the central Arctic Ocean at 89{\cyrchar\CYRNJE}N. The linear partition model was used to indirectly assess if PCBs were equilibrated between water and the extractable organic matter (EOM) of zooplankton. As an independent test, the relation between the EOM-normalized partition coefficient (log KEOM) and trophic level (TL) of the zooplankton (based on ␦15N) was investigated. All log K{\textendash}log KOW regressions were significant (n ϭ 18, p Ͻ 0.05, r2 ϭ 0.65{\textendash}0.95), being consistent with near-equilibrium partitioning and indirectly suggesting the absence of biomagnification. No correlation was found between log KEOM and TL, further supporting the apparent absence of biomagnification in zooplankton. One implication of these results is a reduced uncertainty in modeling of food web uptake, in which kinetic parameterizations of biodilution or biomagnification in zooplankton may be replaced by a simpler parameterization based on equilibrium partitioning.},

In SAO as well as in BS the measurements confirmed freely dissolved concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls, DDT and its metabolites, chlorobenzenes, cyclodiene pesticides, and brominated flame retardants in the range of units to low hundreds of pg per litre. The findings indicate that the spatial distribution of HOCs and emerging pollutants in the SAO and the BS is influenced by riverine inputs, ocean currents and atmospheric deposition from continental plumes. Observed concentration gradients indicate that eastern SAO receives DDT from sources in South Africa, whereas the emissions of endosulfan originate in South America. Elevated HOC concentrations in the northwestern BS are related to their discharge by rivers from the European continent.},

However, DDTs and HCHs levels in various sea areas were closely associated with local pesticides production and application as well as hydrodynamic. DDTs and HCHs showed an obvious spatial distribution pattern. High levels were found in the Bohai Bay, Haihe River and Yellow River estuary. DDTs and HCHs concentrations in river and estuary sediments were higher than sea sediments and a seaward decreasing trend was observed. Although HCHs and DDTs residues in the Bohai Sea primarily originated from river runoffs (pesticide factory wastewater, historical applications and residues of technical HCH and DDT, etc.), additional sources of lindane and dicofol existed. Runoff from the demolished old pesticide factories might be another source.

  abstract = {Decades of atmospheric research have focused on the Western North Atlantic Ocean (WNAO) region because of its unique location that offers accessibility for airborne and ship measurements, gradients in important atmospheric parameters, and a range of meteorological regimes leading to diverse conditions that are poorly understood. This work reviews these scientific investigations for the WNAO region, including the East Coast of North America and the island of Bermuda. Over 50 field campaigns and long-term monitoring programs, in addition to 715 peer-reviewed publications between 1946 and 2019 have provided a firm foundation of knowledge for these areas. Of particular importance in this region has been extensive work at the island of Bermuda that is host to important time series records of oceanic and atmospheric variables. Our review categorizes WNAO atmospheric research into eight major categories, with some studies fitting into multiple categories (relative \%): Aerosols (25\%), Gases (24\%), Development/Validation of Techniques, Models, and Retrievals (18\%), Meteorology and Transport (9\%), Air-Sea Interactions (8\%), Clouds/Storms (8\%), Atmospheric Deposition (7\%), and Aerosol-Cloud Interactions (2\%). Recommendations for future research are provided in the categories highlighted above.},

Air parcel back trajectories suggested that air concentrations over the Kattegat Sea are largely dependent of air mass origin. Seasonal trends were detected for airborne HCHs and for PCBs in water.

  abstract = {Concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons such as. HCH isomers and DDT compounds were determined in air and surface water samples taken from the Western Pacific, Eastern Indian and Antarctic Oceans. The most interesting finding was their presence in measurable concentrations in the Antarctic Ocean. Chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides are widely distributed in the open ocean environment over both the northern and southern hemispheres, and some characteristic distribution patterns of pesticide species in different oceanic regions were observed both in air and water samples. HCH residues found in the northern hemisphere were much higher in concentration than those in the southern hemisphere. On the other hand, higher concentrations of DDT residues were found in the tropical regions, but their levels were not so different between both the northern and southern hemispheres. HCH isomers found in the northern hemisphere had the following order of concentrations: a-HCH{$>$}r-HCH{$>\sptilde$}-HCH, while in the southern hemisphere T-HCH was apparently dominant. DDT compound compositions were rather uniform in all the oceans surveyed, and more than 50 \% was p, pt-DDT. These facts can be explained by the world wide situation regarding pesticide use and the physicochemical properties of the pesticides such as their vapor pressures and water solubilities. In addition, the meridional circulation of the atmosphere, particularly the mass flows of the Hadley and Ferrel cells in the troposphere, also contributes to the atmospheric transport and global distribution of these pesticides.},

Although the Arctic is remote from the main use areas of these chemicals, PCBs have been found in Arctic air, seawater and biota, which has caused concerns for human and environmental health. We used 20-day backward calculations of the Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model FLEXPART to identify the origin of air masses associated with the 20\% highest and lowest measured PCB concentrations. At Birkenes, high concentrations are clearly associated with air masses arriving from known source regions (primarily in Europe and Russia), whereas low concentrations are correlated with atmospheric transport from regions with low primary emissions. At Zeppelin, the influence from known source regions is also enhanced when high PCB-28 and PCB-101 concentrations were measured. At Alert, in contrast, there is no clear link between high/low PCB concentrations and atmospheric transport from source/non-source regions. Additionally, we combined the atmospheric transport patterns with PCB emission data to identify important source regions and their seasonal variability. For the Arctic stations, Western Russia is the dominant source region for PCB-28 and PCB-101. Central Europe is the most important source region for PCB-180, but sources in the US contribute up to 15\% to PCB-180 measured at Alert.},

The occurrence of PCBs was assessed in two populations of the intertidal sea anemone Bunodosoma zamponii living under different anthropogenic strains. One location was in vicinity to a wastewater plant (Las Delicias, LD), and the other was a preserved location chosen as a reference site (Punta Cantera, PC). Anemone populations were sampled 4 times (spring, summer, autumn and winter) throughout a year, in addition to seawater and sediment from those areas. PCB loadings ranged from 2.89 to 79.41 ng L\- -1 in seawater samples and from 0.07 to 6.61 ng g\- -1 dry weight in sediment samples. Total PCB levels ranged from 0.22 to 14.94 and 2.79 to 24.69 ng g\- -1 wet weight in anemones from PC and LD, respectively. PCBs concentrations in anemones from LD were significantly greater than PC during spring, summer and winter. The congeners 18 and 44 prevailed in seawater samples, 44 and 52 in sediment and 18 and 132+153 in anemones. Redundancy analysis integrated PCB levels from all matrixes and bolstered contrast between sampling sites. Seasonality was also a relevant factor since during winter PCB loading was greater in sediment and anemone samples, coincident with the rainiest season. Disparity between sites could be due to LD's proximity to the wastewater plant, effect of littoral drift direction and/or asymmetries in anemones physiological condition.},

Although POPs were detected in Antarctica decades ago, there are still large knowledge gaps and a comprehensive understanding of their fundamental patterns is lacking. In this study, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs, including the non-Aroclor PCB-11), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were measured in surface snow samples from five selected locations of Northern Victoria Land. To our knowledge this is the first study providing groundbased measurements of PCDD/Fs, PCB-11 and PBDEs in Antarctic surface snows, including the plateau. Longrange atmospheric transport (LRAT) followed by regional redistribution were hypothesized as governing sources of POPs to the Antarctic Plateau, but also local pollution from human activities was found. Sub-pg L-1 levels of PCDD/Fs were detected in the coastal samples, while PCBs ({$\Sigma$}PCBs 110-580 pg L-1) generally showed a decrease with respect to the past decades. Similar concentrations of PBDEs ({$\Sigma$}BDEs 130{\textendash}340 pg L-1) were found, mainly attributable to the congeners BDE-47 and BDE-99. PAHs ({$\Sigma$}PAHs 0.65{\textendash}140 ng L-1) were the most abundant compounds in all sites with an unexpected high value near a refueling point.

Here we develop a global 3-D ocean simulation for four polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) spanning a range of molecular weights and volatilities to better understand effects of climate-driven changes in ocean biogeochemistry on the lifetime and distribution of POPs. Observations are most abundant in the Arctic Ocean. There, model results reproduce spatial patterns and magnitudes of measured PCB concentrations. Sorption of PCBs to suspended particles and subsequent burial in benthic marine sediment is the dominant oceanic loss process globally. Results suggest benthic sediment burial has removed 75\% of cumulative PCB releases since the onset of production in 1930. Wind speed, light penetration, and ocean circulation exert a stronger and more variable influence on volatile PCB congeners with lower particle affinity such as chlorinated biphenyl-28 and chlorinated biphenyl-101. In the Arctic Ocean between 1992 and 2015, modeled evasion (losses) of the more volatile PCB congeners from the surface ocean increased due to declines in sea ice and changes in ocean circulation. By contrast, net deposition increased slightly for higher molecular weight congeners with stronger partitioning to particles. Our results suggest future climate changes will have the greatest impacts on the chemical lifetimes and distributions of volatile POPs with lower molecular weights.           ,              Key Points                                                                Climate change will have the greatest impacts on the chemical lifetimes and distributions of volatile persistent organic pollutants                                                     Marine sediment has sequestered 75\% of cumulative releases of polychlorinated biphenyls since the onset of production in 1930                                                     Arctic sea ice retreat is likely to enhance losses of volatile congeners but increase net deposition of higher molecular weight congeners},

Two subsamples were retained from each size fraction.

The sorption was found to vary depending on the hydrophobicity of the compounds, the structure of the cell membranes, and the lipid content and composition of the cells. The absorption increased for the TCB and the HCB in the largest size fraction over time, which coincided with an increase of the neutral and non-polar lipids. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Pollutants in the northern East China Sea were generally higher than that in the southern East China Sea and South China Sea, which may be attribute to river discharges and land sources in the Yangtze River Delta. The Yellow Sea Coastal Current and Yangtze River Dilute Water drove the transport of contaminants from north to south marginal seas. Positive correlations between EC and PAHs were found, which can be explained by co-emission of them during combustion. Moreover, positive correlations between OC, EC and Log Kd for BkF, BeP, HCB, 6:2 FTSA were found, which demonstrated that OC and EC promoted the partitioning of these high oleophilic compounds to suspended particle.},

  abstract = {A three-year sampling campaign (Jan 2011{\textendash}Jan 2014) was conducted on organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) using high-volume air sampling nearby the Chinese Great Wall Station, west Antarctica. The concentrations of {$\sum$}23OCPs ranged between 5.87 and 27.9 pg m-3 (mean 14.3 {$\pm$} 5.4 pg m-3), and no temporal trend was observed over the entire sampling period. However, the dominant compound, hexachlorobezene (HCB) (71\% on average of {$\sum$}23OCPs), exhibited a seasonal variation with higher levels in the austral winter. Gas-particle partitioning of OCPs was explored based on KOA absorption model, steady-state model and Junge{\textendash}Pankow adsorption model. LogKP showed significantly negative correlations with logPL0 of OCPs (p {$<$} 0.01, the slope is -0.30) and TSP values in the samples (p {$<$} 0.01), suggesting absorption by the organic matter as the dominant sorption process and TSP as an important factor influencing gas-particle partitioning of OCPs in this remote environment. The chiral signature indicated a commonly nonracemic residue of {$\alpha$}-HCH and o,p'-DDT in the Antarctic air. The deviation from racemic (DFR) of o,p'-DDT showed a strongly negative dependence on its concentration (p {$<$} 0.01), properly suggesting more fresh input of o,p'-DDT after 2011. Preferential depletion of (+) {$\alpha$}-HCH was observed mainly in gas phase, indicating the influence of re-volatilization of chiral compounds from source areas and/or ocean on their enantiomeric composition in remote air. Source apportionment demonstrated that long range atmospheric transport (LRAT) was the main transport pathway of OCPs, while nonracemic residues of HCHs and DDTs indicated a contribution of secondary source emission, i.e. seawater-air exchange, to their occurrence in west Antarctica.},

  abstract = {CoZMo-POP 2, a dynamic multimedia fate and transport model (MFTM) for describing the long-term fate of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in a coastal environment or the drainage basin of a large lake is described. The modelled environment, consisting of up to 19 compartments, includes the forest, soils and fresh water bodies of the drainage basin, and a variable number of sequentially arranged marine water units, representing estuarine, coastal, open and deep water environments. Two sediment compartments in each water basin allow to account for the possibility of the simultaneous occurrence of eroding and accumulating bottoms in a water basin. As the movement of POPs in the environment is closely associated with the movement of air, water and organic matter, the model constructs complete steady state mass budgets for air, water and particulate organic carbon (POC) between the model compartments from the environmental parameters supplied by the user. This assures that these input parameters, which can be stored in a database, are all mutually compatible and internally consistent. The CoZMo-POP 2 model takes into account seasonably variable wind speeds, temperatures, canopy developments and OH radical concentrations, and allows for the definition of time-variant emission scenarios. CoZMo-POP 2 is a flexible, dynamic MFTM that can be used for detailed investigation of a particular fate process using a generic environmental scenario, as well as for simulations of the behaviour of a particular POP in a particular environment. All of the model equations, which are expressed in fugacity notation, are provided. {\'O} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A series of theoretical and semi-empirical approaches, including the zonally averaged global fate and transport model Globo-POP, were used to estimate the rate of loss of selected polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners from the global environment, and the relative contribution of atmospheric degradation and transfer to the deep sea to this loss. The atmospheric fate of PCBs is highly dependent on the OH radical concentration, temperature and the latter's influence on the gas/particle partitioning equilibrium. The PCB loss was found to be very congener specific. Atmospheric reaction with the OH radical is the major loss process for the lighter and intermediate PCB congeners, whereas particle-bound transfer to the deep sea dominates the loss of the congeners with a large number of chlorine substituents. As concentrations in air and seawater decline more rapidly than in the terrestrial environment, other loss processes such as degradation in soils are gaining in relative importance with time. Estimated lifetimes of the PCBs in the global environment are on the order of decades, with significant differences between congeners. Research needs are identified that would allow improvements of these estimates.},

Other organics (HCB, alpha, gamma and total HCH, dieldrin, and chlordane) showed smaller increases downwind. Downwind concentrations were less than those found along the east coast of North America. Upwind values were similar to other ``remote'' North Atlantic data; taken together, they show that the North Atlantic atmosphere, while clean, is not pristine.},

But for solving many problems in this context, knowledge of the emission sources, transport pathways, and sites of deposition is of great benefit. By far the largest amounts of pollutants, regardless of where they were discharged, end up in the soil or the aquatic environment. By defining the source of origin of compounds like PAHs, and PCBs in the environment, especially in areas where they are emitted from different sources, it is possible to obtain information on the nature of different materials that are sources of these compounds (e.g., petroleum), or on the processes during which they are formed (e.g., combustion). In addition, the fate of toxic compounds in the environment can be tracked. This knowledge enables hypotheses to be formulated regarding the course of environmental phenomena; it also supplies a tool for taking administrative action and for resolving disputed issues concerning environmental pollution.},

HCHs, DDTs, and chlordanes cause substantial contamination of the air and seawater of the East China Sea (ECS), indicating significant OCP inputs from China. Isomer ratios of HCHs and DDTs provided a fingerprint of East Asian emissions of legacy OCPs, with the pollution profiles of HCHs and DDTs dominated by lindane and combined dicofol-type and weathered technical DDTs, respectively. The former result is consistent with the apparent decline in air {$\alpha$}-HCH levels over the ECS. Different from still net deposition of gaseous {$\alpha$}- and {$\gamma$}-HCH in the NWP, outgassing of trans-chlordane, cis-chlordane, and DDTs other than dicofol-sourced o,p{${'}$}-DDT was indicated. This observation attributes to intensive historical usage of technical HCHs and the prevalence of lindane pollution in East Asia, and demonstrates the transitioning role of seawater as a source for residual OCPs in the East Asia-NWP region. Significant subcooled liquid vapor pressure-based relationships for legacy OCPs were identified mainly in marine air masses; these were different from land-sourced polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and suggested a heterogeneous role of ocean- and landbased sources in atmospheric partitioning of these pollutants.},

Total PCB concentrations in the atmosphere ranged from 56.8 to 261 pg m{\`A}3. Higher PCB levels were observed off the coast and minor temperature-induced changes showed that continuous emissions from East Asia remain as an important source to the regional atmosphere. A significant relationship between Koa (octanoleair partition coefficient) and KP (gaseparticle partition coefficient) for PCBs was observed under continental air masses, suggesting that land-derived organic aerosols affected the PCB gaseparticle partitioning after long-range transport, while an absence of this correlation was identified in marine air masses. The PCB partitioning cannot be fully explained by the absorptive mechanism as the predicted KP were found to be 2e3 orders of magnitude lower than the measured Kp, while the prediction was closely matched when soot adsorption was considered. The results suggested the importance of soot carbon as a transport medium for PCBs during their long-range transport and considerable impacts of continental outflows on PCBs across the downwind area. The estimated transport mass of particulate PCBs into the ECS and NWP totals 2333 kg during the spring, constituting ca. 17\% of annual emission inventories of unintentionally produced PCB in China.},

The mean concentrations were observed for hexachlorobenzene (HCB) {$>$}SPCBs {$>$}Shexachlorocyclohexanes(HCHs) {$>$}Sdichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDTs){$>$}Schlordanes. High levels of HCB were found near east Antarctica and in the Ross Sea, reflecting the re-emission of HCB from environmental reservoirs of these regions. Parent DDTs (p,p'- and o,p'-DDT) were rarely detected, suggesting that atmospheric DDT was predominantly influencedby weathered DDT from some secondarysources. However, fresh inputs of DDTs could not be excluded because there were still some samples with high proportions of parent DDTs. HCHs only were detected in the South Indian Ocean (near Australia), andthis result might be related to the intense emissions of HCHs from southern Australia. Ratios of trans-chlordane/cis-chlordanein most samples were lower than that in technical chlordane, reflecting the main influence of weathered chlordane. High levels of SPCBs were found in the Ross Sea, suggesting an intense re-emission of PCBs. Furthermore, atmospheric PCBs near the Antarctic Peninsula were also relatively high, this finding might be attributed to the emissions of PCBs from nearby Antarctic research stations. Comparing with the Arctic, transport of OCPs and PCBs towards Antarctica is more difficult. The Antarctic marginal seas would act as both barriers and ``buffer zones''during the transportation processes.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous measurements of organochlorine compounds (OCs) in seawater, the sea-surface microlayer and the atmosphere were conducted in June{\textendash}July 2004 in the coastal marine environment of Singapore. Together, these measurements represent the first data on the flux of OCs between the ocean and atmosphere reported in the scientific literature that take into account the implication of the sea surface microlayer (SML) as a controlling boundary layer for the exchange of OCs. The average fluxes of {$\Sigma$}PCBs and {$\Sigma$}HCHs were 127.5 and - 32.8 ng m- 2 day-1 respectively using a modified two-layer model (negative flux indicates adsorption by the ocean). The average fluxes using a conventional approach, ignoring the SML as boundary layer (classical twolayer model), were 67.2 and -43.1 ng m- 2 day-1 for {$\Sigma$}PCBs and {$\Sigma$}HCHs, respectively. However, the maximum difference in the flux calculation between the two approaches was up to 15-fold for individual compounds at high enrichment in the SML. It is shown that the SML plays an important role in the control of air{\textendash}sea gas exchange of OCs, particular under a low prevailing wind regime and with an enrichment of OCs in the SML. The physical and chemical properties of OCs are critical factors in the control of the air{\textendash}sea gas exchange process, and the effect of the SML on this process is more significant for more hydrophobic OCs.},

The areas around the two bays are both densely populated, thrived with intensive agriculture and industrial activities. Multi-techniques including GC{\textendash}MS, GC{\textendash}lECD coupled with chemical peak confirmation and strict QC procedures were used for the quantitative determination of 15 OCPs including alpha, beta, gamma and delta isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB), heptachlor, aldrin, endosulfan, p,p0-DDE, dieldrin, endrin, p,p0-DDD, o,p0-DDT, p,p0-DDT and methoxychlor. The survey results show that contaminations by OCP residues remain widespread in the areas, but the averaged concentration levels are all below the regulatory limits, e.g., CMC limits (acute criterion values) specified in US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and China national standards. Average concentration of OCPs in water samples were from undetectable to 3.8 ng l{\`A}1 in LaiZhou Bay and from 0.1 to 3.9 ng l{\`A}1 in JiaoZhou Bay, respectively. A comparison between the current and historical data shows a rapidly decreasing trend of OCPs over the past twenty years in the study areas.},

Seasonally, in the NSCS, the significantly higher concentrations (p {$<$} 0.05) of HCB, HCHs, and DDTs were found in summer, autumn, and summer through autumn, respectively. In the ECS, the higher concentrations were found in summer through winter, autumn, and summer. Spatially, HCB concentrations were significantly higher in the NSCS than in the ECS during all seasons except winter. During all four seasons, concentrations of HCHs were significantly higher in the NSCS than in the ECS. In summer and autumn, concentrations of DDTs were significantly higher in the NSCS than in the ECS, while no significant differences were found in spring and winter. Generally, regional usage, river-influenced coastal plumes, phytoplankton abundances, and ocean currents played crucial roles in the input, transport, degradation, and dilution of OCPs. These dynamic factors along with the seasonally alternating monsoon directly influenced the seasonal and spatial characteristics of OCPs. Furthermore, the profiles and diagnostic ratios of HCHs and DDTs revealed highly weathered OCP residues, attributed to eroded soils carried by surface runoff and long-range oceanic and atmospheric transport.},

The {$\sum$}24PCBs (6.8{\textendash}294 pg m-3) were mainly influenced by air mass origins in air samples. Southeast monsoon caused higher {$\sum$}24PCBs (mean: 61 pg m-3) than the southwest (mean: 19 pg m-3). {$\sum$}24PCBs in seawater (2.8{\textendash}7.7 pg L-1) was equally distributed from the nearshore to offshore regions under low flow velocity and swirling state of the ocean current. Significantly higher air-water gas exchange deposition fluxes (3.5{\textendash}29 ng m-2 d-1) than dry deposition (0.14{\textendash}2.0 ng m-2 d-1) indicated that diffusion of PCBs from the atmosphere into seawater was the governing process in the SCS. PCBs in corals are strong bioaccumulative (Log BAFs: 2.49{\textendash}7.86). The distribution of {$\sum$}24PCBs in coral tissues (nd {\textendash} 42.9 ng g-1 dw) was significantly correlated with that in air samples, suggesting PCBs may have a migration pattern of atmosphere-ocean-corals in the SCS. Compared to a previous risk assessment study, the {$\sum$}24PCBs in corals from the SCS may cause potential risks to corals by reducing zooxanthellae density, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and chlorophyll-C2 (Chl{\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}C2) in corals.},

  abstract = {The global oceans are known as terminal sink or secondary source for diffusive emission of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and selected current used pesticides (CUPs) into the overlaying atmosphere. Many pesticides have been widely produced worldwide, subsequently applied, and released into the environment. However, information on the occurrence patterns, spatial variability, and air-seawater exchange of pesticides is limited to easily accessible regions and, hence, only few studies are reported from the remote Southern Ocean. To fill this information gap, a large-scale ship-based sampling campaign was conducted. In the samples from this campaign, we measured concentrations of 221 pesticides. Both gaseous and aqueous samples were collected along a sam\- pling transect from the western Pacific to the Southern Ocean (19.75{$\smwhtcircle$} N-76.16{$\smwhtcircle$} S) from November 2018 to March 2019. Twenty-seven individual pesticides were frequently ({$\geq$} 50\%) detected in gaseous and aqueous samples. Tebuconazole, diphenylamine, myclobutanil, and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) dominated the composition profile in both phases. Spatial trends analysis in atmospheric and seawater concentrations showed a substantial level reduction from the western Pacific towards the Southern Ocean. Back-trajectory analysis showed that atmo\- spheric pesticide concentrations were strongly influenced by air masses origins. Continental and riverine inputs are important sources of pesticides in the western Pacific and Indian Oceans. Atmospheric and seawater con\- centrations for the target pesticide residues in the Southern Ocean are low and evenly distributed due to the large distance from potential pollution sources as well as the effective isolation by the Antarctic Convergence (AC). Air-seawater fugacity ratios and fluxes indicated that the western Pacific and Indian Oceans were secondary sources for most pesticides emitted to the atmosphere, while the Southern Ocean was still considered to be a sink.},

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and some pesticides were measured in air, water, and zooplankton tracking the North Atlantic Bloom in May 2008. Lower weight PCBs were entering the water column from the atmosphere during the main bloom period but reached equilibrium after the bloom collapsed. The PCBs in the lipids of zooplankton Calanus were in equilibrium with those in the dissolved phase. A Lagrangian box model was developed to simulate the dissolved phase PCBs and pesticides by including the following processes: air-water exchange, reversible sorption to POC, changes in mixed layer depth, removal by sinking particles, and degradation. Results suggest that sorption to (sinking) POC was the dominant removal process for hydrophobic pollutants from seawater. Statistical test suggested simulated results were not significantly different from observed values for hydrophobic pollutants (p,p'-DDE).},

Seawater OCP ({$\Sigma$}7OCPs) concentrations displayed rapid and significant seasonal variations during mid-late summer. The ocean is the most significant atmospheric-OCP source region for the Arctic, and feedback affects the middle- or low-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The legacy OCP concentrations in the Arctic Ocean were shown to gradually decrease with distance from water masses originating in the Bering Sea and the landmass of Alaska. This study is the first updated investigation of OCPs along the North Pacific Ocean to the Arctic Ocean transect in the past decade. It provides updated field data on the global fate of OCPs in a region undergoing rapid climate change. Plain Language Summary We investigated four hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and three dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) in the marine boundary and their fate corresponding to the geophysical climate change from East Asia to the high Arctic during two Arctic Research Expedition cruises. Levels of OCPs in the surface seawater between the forward and return voyages along the same transect indicated the rapid seasonal variation. The reducing DDT contamination and comparable HCH levels to the previous studies in the low-latitude regions indicated the effective control measures in the past decades. However, the potential point source and agriculture activities still resulted in the high levels of DDTs in East Asia. Water mass from the Bering Sea significantly affected the levels of dissolved OCPs in the Arctic Ocean, while China, Japan, and East Russia were the crucial source regions for the atmospheric OCPs in East Asia. The Arctic Ocean becomes a significant source region, and possible feedback affects the low-latitude regions in East Asia.},

Deposition of target compounds from the air to seawater was observed to be much higher in July compared with depositional fluxes for March and May, except for chlorpyrifos (with volatilisation fluxes in all sampling periods: {\textasciitilde}25\,ng\,m{\textendash}2\,day{\textendash}1). Concentrations of trifluralin in seawater appear to have decreased since its restriction of use in European Union member states, with net volatilisation from seawater observed in March (flux: 6.3\,{$\pm$}\,7.2\,ng\,m{\textendash}2\,day{\textendash}1). With the exception of chlorpyrifos, our results indicate that volatilisation from local sources combined with long-range transport from Western Europe and subsequent deposition are important pathways for these compounds to German Bight seawater during summer periods.},

  abstract = {Samples of sub-surface water, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and surface sediments collected from Daya Bay, China have been analysed for 12 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and 18 organochlorine insecticides, using gas chromatography electron capture detection. Total PCB levels varied from 91.1 to 1355.3 ng l{\`A}1 in water and from 0.85 to 27.37 ng g{\`A}1 dry weight in sediments. The levels of total organochlorine insecticides were in the range 143.3{$\pm$}5104.8 ng l{\`A}1 in water and 2.43{$\pm$}86.25 ng g{\`A}1 dry weight in sediment. None of the target compounds were detected in SPM. The levels of total hexachlorocyclohexanes in water varied from 35.5 to 1228.6 ng l{\`A}1, whilst in sediments they ranged from 0.32 to 4.16 ng g{\`A}1 dry weight. For the sum of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), their levels were in the range 26.8{$\pm$}975.9 ng l{\`A}1 in water, and 0.14{$\pm$}20.27 ng g{\`A}1 dry weight in sediments. The distribution pro{\textregistered}les of these contaminants in water and sediments suggest that there are a number of sources contributing to total contaminant burden in the bay, including soil runos, wastewater discharges, sewage outfalls and shipping activities. Ratios of DDT/(DDE+DDD) in the water and sediments indicate recent inputs of such chemicals into the bay. The results, therefore, provide important information on the current contamination status of a key aquacultural area in China, and point to the need for urgent actions to stop the use of persistent agrochemicals such as DDT and lindane. \# 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in the seawater collected in the Bering and Chukchi Seas during the First Chinese Arctic Research Expedition were confirmed by gas chromatography{\textendash}mass spectrometry (GC{\textendash}MS) and analyzed by capillary gas chromatography with micro-electron capture detector (GC-mECD). The average of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs; sum of isomers a-, b-, g-, d-) was nearly equal in the Bering Sea (mean concentration 412.7 pg/l) and in the Chukchi Sea (mean concentration 445.8 pg/ l), which showed no obvious latitudinal difference of these two regions. Compared with previously reported studies, concentrations of OCPs in these regions were much lower than the levels in the last decades. The ratio of :
 HCH was 5.0 and 3.4 for the Bering and Chukchi sea, respectively, which indicated the different pesticide composition in these two regions. Many other OCPs with different residue patterns were also found for the first time in the investigation regions. Heptachlor epoxide (in the Bering Sea) and heptachlor (in the Chukchi Sea) were main OCPs contaminants besides HCHs. \# 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},
